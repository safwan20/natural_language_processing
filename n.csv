0,OPEC backs extra 1.5 million bpd output cut if Russia joins in: Report,"OPEC agreed on Thursday to cut output by an extra 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second quarter of 2020 to support prices amid an outbreak of coronavirus but made it conditional on Russia joining in, two OPEC sources said. Saudi Arabia had suggested OPEC and its allies, including Russia, cut up to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) for the second quarter of 2020 while keeping existing cuts of 2.1 million bpd, which expire this month, in place until the end of 2020.But Riyadh, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and other members of the group have yet to win Russian support for such a deal. So far, Moscow has indicated it would back an extension but not a deeper cut.Moscow, which has co-operated on output policy since 2016 in an informal group known as OPEC+, has in the past shown reluctance during negotiations but has signed up at the last minute.OPEC sources have signalled that preliminary talks with Russia this week in Vienna have been trickier than before.Brent oil prices rose 0.6% towards $51.50 a barrel on news of the OPEC cut. This year's slide in oil prices by about 20% has made it tough for OPEC states to balance their budgets, while Moscow has said it can cope with current prices.If OPEC+ was to decide to remove an extra 1.5 million bpd from the market, it would bring the group's overall output reduction to 3.6 million bpd or about 3.6% of global supplies.Russia's energy minister returned to Moscow for consultations on Wednesday but will be back in Vienna on Friday for the broader OPEC+ meeting. Novak made no public statements during his trip this week to Vienna.""Our expectation is that OPEC+ will deliver a credible and coherent strategy that will take more barrels that what’s priced into the market off the table,"" said Ehsan Khoman from Mitsubishi UFG, adding that stimulus by governments and central banks around the world would help reassure markets.Oil demand has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. Original forecasts for growth in crude demand in 2020 have been slashed, as factory operations, travel and other economic activities around the world have been curtailed by measures aiming to stop the virus spreading."
1,Cricket in times of coronavirus: Lot at stake as IPL targets smooth start,"Cricket's slow geographical expansion is turning out to be a blessing in disguise for the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) which looks set to beat the dreaded novel coronavirus threat and go ahead as scheduled. At a time when the number of recorded deaths because of the deadly outbreak across the globe is touching 3500 with a plethora of international sporting events getting cancelled, the IPL seems to be in a parallel universe where ""all is well"".And there are multiple practical reasons why the T20 extravaganza will be held as per schedule.A major reason is the small number of countries that play the game and an even smaller fraction of overseas players, who will compete in the world's richest cricket league starting March 29 in Mumbai.Till Thursday, the reported number of positive COVID-19 cases in India stood at 29, including 16 Italian tourists.However, none of the overseas recruits of eight IPL franchises have expressed any apprehensions about travelling to India.Just over 60 players from cricket nations such as Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and the Caribbean islands comprise the elite foreign brigade and the reported positive cases of coronavirus in all these countries is next to none.""The IOC is saying Olympics in Tokyo will be held as per schedule. IPL is a minuscule tournament in that regard. If Olympics can be held, there's no reason why IPL can't be held,"" a BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The second and perhaps the biggest reason is broadcasters.Star Sports has bought the rights for  ₹16,347 crore (USD 2.55 billion) for a period of five years and their advertising revenues will take a huge hit if the tournament doesnt go ahead as planned. Former Delhi Daredevils CEO Hemant Dua explained the economics. ""Look Star as well as BCCI has got everything insured. I don't know if there is any specific insurance cover for cancellation due to coronavirus but there is no chance of that happening if I read the situation properly,"" Dua told PTI.He then explained that even Star has got their TV rights deal insured.""Like every insurance claim, they will not get probably 100 percent but 80 percent money will be recovered. But that's not the point. The advertisement revenues will not come which is a huge loss. Personally, I see no reason for cancellation,"" Dua said. ""Each and every match is also separately insured. So neither the BCCI nor the franchises will lose anything. But cancellation means scrapped for the year as this is the window. It can't be rescheduled,"" a senior BCCI official said.The BCCI is also depending on the guidelines given by the government with regards to dealing with the health crisis.""Every person availing international flights will be screened for coronavirus at the port of entry. That is the biggest health security measure. Obviously the BCCI will strictly adhere to any health advisory that government will issue,"" a Board official said.But since there is an advisory that social gatherings are inadvisable at this point, won't it affect the league?""You will only come to know once the ticket sales start. If the stadiums are packed, that means people are coming but if stands are largely empty, then you can presume that people are wary."" "

3,UK court rejects Nirav Modi's bail plea for fifth time,"LONDON :A UK court on Thursday rejected for the fifth time the bail plea of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who is fighting his extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case.

7,"DoT, BSNL pensioners plan Parliament march next week","NEW DELHI :Retired employees of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and BSNL are planning to organise a march to Parliament next week for demanding revision in their pension and its delinking from wage revision. ""All-India BSNL DOT Pensioners Association (AIBDPA) is all set for a Parliament March on March 12, 2020. The demand put forward is pension revision of BSNL absorbed retirees from January 1, 2017, with 15 per cent fitment based on new pay scales, delinking wage revision,"" the Association said in a statement.AIBDPA said former telecom minister Manoj Sinha had assured the All Unions and Associations of BSNL (AUAB) on December 3, 2018, that an action will be initiated to revise the pension of BSNL absorbed retirees delinking wage revision.The DoT based on this assurance wrote two letters to the Department of Pension and Pensioners Welfare, but failed to give the proposal as required by the pension department, the statement said.""The second term of (Narendra) Modi government has disowned the assurance given by the former minister and has taken a negative stand on pension revision,"" AIBDPA alleged.It said current Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, while replying to a question in Parliament, said pension revision is possible only after wage revision in BSNL and also new pay scales are required for the pension revision.""The fact remains that pension revision has no way connected to BSNL, as the entire liability of pension and pensionary benefits of BSNL absorbed retirees is to be borne by the central government as per Rule 37A of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972,"" the statement said.The Association said it has already been recommended by the 3rd Pay Revision Committee (PRC) for the executives, and in respect of non-executives, pay scales have been approved by the BSNL management and recognised unions through bilateral talks.""Therefore, it is unjust on the part of the government to deny the pension revision even after three years,"" the statement said.The 3rd PRC has recommended a maximum of 15% fitment for the pay revision from January 1, 2017."
8,Coronavirus: Media and entertainment events hit across India,"New Delhi: As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rises by the day in India, several media and entertainment events have been either postponed or have their fate shrouded in ambiguity with no concrete decision on whether it is safe for such large crowds to gather. Advertising, media and entertainment festival, Goafest organized by the Advertising Club and the Advertising Agencies Association of India, has been postponed until further notice. The event was to be held in Goa from 2-4 April. The one-year celebrations of Swedish audio streaming service Spotify to be held in Mumbai later this month have been postponed. The event was to be attended by Spotify's global CEO Daniel Ek. The jury is still not out on FICCI Frames, the annual media and entertainment event organized in Mumbai by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The annual advertising, marketing and technology event adtech too has been postponed. This was done after careful consideration and advice from partners and the advisory board regarding the event scheduled to be held on 19 and 20 March in Gurugram. Light and new media art festival, emrg2020 to be held in the national capital, has also been pushed.“The move has been taken considering the heightened global concerns on the spread of the Coronavirus posing a threat to well-being and safety of festival goers. The festival also receives many speakers from across the world and travel advisories issued across countries and organizations against being a part of large gatherings has also contributed to the decision. In such challenging times it is critical that everybody acts responsibly and does their best to prevent any escalation of the already fairly alarming scenario,"" the Goafest team said in a statement.Spotify emphasized that this decision comes as part of the company’s effort to ensure that no one’s health and safety are compromised.""It was extremely tough for us to take a call because every year we have around 6,000 attendees from all over the world. Unfortunately the best thing for us to do right now is to postpone it and that's what we will do. We will assess how the COVID-19 situation will pan out and then we will come out with new dates,"" Neha Takkar, head of marketing, adtech, said.(Saumya Tewari contributed to this story)"
9,Smartphones may make your headaches worse: AIIMS,"NEW DELHI :Smartphone users who suffer from regular headaches and migraines may be more likely to use painkillers and find less relief, say researchers at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). For the study, published in the jorunal Neurology: Clinical Practice, researchers have identified 400 people in India with a primary headache condition, which includes migraine, tension headache and other headache types that are not due to another condition.""While the results need to be confirmed with larger and more rigorous studies, the findings are concerning, as smartphone use is growing rapidly and has been linked to a number of symptoms, with headache being the most common,"" said study author Deepti Vibha, from AIIMS in New Delhi.According to the researchers, the study does not prove that smartphone use causes greater use of pain medication and less relief; it only shows an association.For the findings, the research team asked the people about their smartphone use and their headaches and medication use.Of the 400 people, 206 were smartphone users and 194 were non-users.People who did not use smartphones were older, had a lower education level and were more likely to have a low socioeconomic status than those who did use smartphones.The smartphone users were more likely to take pain-relieving drugs for their headaches than non-users, with 96% of smartphone users taking the drugs as compared to 81% of non-users.Smartphone users took an average of eight pills per month compared to five pills per month for non-users, the study said.Smartphone users also reported less relief from the medication, with 84% gaining moderate or complete relief of headache pain compared to 94% of non-users.However, the study did not find any difference between the two groups in how often headaches occurred, how long they lasted or how severe they were.The researchers noted that the study only examined people at one point in time; it did not follow them to look for changes over time.""The root of the problem is not yet clear. Is it a user's neck position? Or the phone's lighting? Or eye strain? Or the stress of being connected at all times? Answers will likely emerge in upcoming years and eventually guide strategies for more sustainable use of the devices,"" said Heidi Moawad, member of the American Academy of Neurology.""Features such as hands-free settings, voice activation and audio functions could potentially hold the key to helping smartphone users benefit from their phones without exacerbating their headaches,"" Moawad added."
10,Coronavirus could cost airlines $113 billion revenue in 2020: IATA,"Singapore: The airline industry could lose up to $113 billion in revenue this year due to the impact of the new coronavirus, an industry body warned Thursday, as the epidemic spreads rapidly worldwide. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated revenue losses to airlines' passenger business of between $63 billion and $113 billion -- with the higher figure for a scenario where the virus spreads more widely.The more dire prediction amounts to a 19% loss in worldwide passenger revenues, IATA said.""Financially, that would be on a scale equivalent to what the industry experienced in the global financial crisis,"" said a statement from the group.It was a far bleaker assessment than two weeks ago, when IATA forecast revenue losses would come in at $29.3 billion.But since then the virus has spread rapidly outside China, where it first emerged late last year, and has now reached some 80 countries and territories.More than 95,000 people have been infected and over 3,200 have died worldwide.""The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent,"" said IATA head Alexandre de Juniac, following a meeting in Singapore.""In little over two months, the industry's prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse.""

11,"China’s Uighurs trapped in factory, forced to work for tech giants, says report","NANCHANG, China: In a lively Muslim quarter of Nanchang city, a sprawling Chinese factory turns out computer screens, cameras and fingerprint scanners for a supplier to international tech giants such as Apple and Lenovo. Throughout the neighborhood, women in headscarves stroll through the streets, and Arabic signs advertise halal supermarkets and noodle shops. Yet the mostly Muslim ethnic Uighurs who labor in the factory are isolated within a walled compound that is fortified with security cameras and guards at the entrance. Their forays out are limited to rare chaperoned trips, they are not allowed to worship or cover their heads, and they must attend special classes in the evenings, according to former and current workers and shopkeepers in the area.The connection between OFILM, the supplier that owns the Nanchang factory, and the tech giants is the latest sign that companies outside China are benefiting from coercive labor practices imposed on the Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group, and other minorities.Over the past four years, the Chinese government has detained more than a million people from the far west Xinjiang region, most of them Uighurs, in internment camps and prisons where they go through forced ideological and behavioral re-education. China has long suspected the Uighurs of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.When detainees “graduate"" from the camps, documents show, many are sent to work in factories. A dozen Uighurs and Kazakhs told the AP they knew people who were sent by the state to work in factories in China’s east, known as inner China — some from the camps, some plucked from their families, some from vocational schools. Most were sent by force, although in a few cases it wasn’t clear if they consented.Workers are often enrolled in classes where state-sponsored teachers give lessons in Mandarin, China’s dominant language, or politics and “ethnic unity."" Conditions in the jobs vary in terms of pay and restrictions.At the OFILM factory, Uighurs are paid the same as other workers but otherwise treated differently, according to residents of the neighborhood. They are not allowed to leave or pray – unlike the Hui Muslim migrants also working there, who are considered less of a threat by the Chinese government.“They don’t let them worship inside,"" said a Hui Muslim woman who worked in the factory for several weeks alongside the Uighurs. “They don’t let them come out.""""If you’re Uighur, you’re only allowed outside twice a month,"" a small business owner who spoke with the workers confirmed. The AP is not disclosing the names of those interviewed near the factory out of concern for possible retribution. “The government chose them to come to OFILM, they didn’t choose it.""The Chinese government says the labor program is a way to train Uighurs and other minorities and give them jobs. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday called concern over possible coerced labor under the program “groundless"" and “slander.""However, experts say that like the internment camps, the program is part of a broader assault on the Uighur culture, breaking up social and family links by sending people far from their homes to be assimilated into the dominant Han Chinese culture.“They think these people are poorly educated, isolated, backwards, can’t speak Mandarin,"" said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne. “So what do you do? You ‘educate’ them, you find ways to transform them in your own image. Bringing them into the Han Chinese heartland is a way to turbocharge this transformation.""OFILM’s website indicates the Xinjiang workers make screens, camera cover lenses and fingerprint scanners. It touts customers including Apple, Samsung, Lenovo, Dell, HP, LG and Huawei, although there was no way for the AP to track specific products to specific companies.Apple’s most recent list of suppliers, published January last year, includes three OFILM factories in Nanchang. It’s unclear whether the specific OFILM factory the AP visited twice in Nanchang supplies Apple, but it has the same address as one listed. Another OFILM factory is located about half a mile away on a different street. Apple did not answer repeated requests for clarification on which factory it uses.In an email, Apple said its code of conduct requires suppliers to “provide channels that encourage employees to voice concerns."" It said it interviews the employees of suppliers during annual assessments in their local language without their managers present, and had done 44,000 interviews in 2018.Lenovo confirmed that it sources screens, cameras, and fingerprint scanners from OFILM but said it was not aware of the allegations and would investigate. Lenovo also pointed to a 2018 audit by the Reliable Business Alliance in which OFILM scored very well.All the companies that responded said they required suppliers to follow strict labor standards. LG and Dell said they had “no evidence"" of forced labor in their supply chains but would investigate, as did Huawei. HP did not respond.OFILM also lists as customers dozens of companies within China, as well as international companies it calls “partners"" without specifying what product it offers. And it supplies PAR Technology, an American sales systems vendor to which it most recently shipped 48 cartons of touch screens in February, according to U.S. customs data obtained through ImportGenius and Panjiva, which track shipping data.PAR Technology in turn says it supplies terminals to major chains such as McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and Subway. However, the AP was unable to confirm that products from OFILM end up with the fast food companies.McDonald’s said it has asked PAR Technology to discontinue purchases from OFILM while it launches an immediate investigation. PAR Technology also said it would investigate immediately. Subway and Taco Bell did not respond.A report Sunday from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, researched separately from the AP, estimated that more than 80,000 Uighurs were transferred from Xinjiang to factories across China between 2017 and 2019. The report said it found “conditions that strongly suggest forced labor"" consistent with International Labor Organization definitions.The AP also reported a year ago that Uighur forced labor was being used within Xinjiang to make sportswear that ended up in the U.S.___FROM FARMERS TO FACTORY WORKERSBeijing first sent Uighurs to work in inland China in the early 2000s, as part of a broad effort to push minorities to adopt urban lifestyles and integrate with the Han Chinese majority to tighten political control.At first the program targeted young, single women, because the state worried that Uighur women raised in pious Muslim families didn’t work, had children early and refused to marry Han men. But as stories of poor pay and tight restrictions trickled back, police began threatening some parents with jail time if they didn’t send their children, six Uighurs told the AP.The program was halted in 2009, when at least two Uighurs died in a brawl with Han workers at a toy factory in coastal Guangdong province. After peaceful protests in Xinjiang were met with police fire, ethnic riots broke out that killed an estimated 200 people, mostly Han Chinese civilians.An AP review of Chinese academic papers and state media reports shows that officials blamed the failure of the labor program on the Uighurs’ language and culture. So when the government ramped up the program again after the ascent of hardline Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2012, it emphasized ideological transformation.A paper drafted by the head of the Xinjiang statistics bureau in 2014 said the Uighurs’ poor Mandarin made it hard for them to integrate in inner China. It concluded that Xinjiang’s rural minorities needed to be broken away from traditional lifestyles and systematically “disciplined"", “trained"" and “instilled with modern values.""“The local saturated religious atmosphere and the long-time living habits of ethnic minorities are incompatible with the requirements of modern industrial production,"" the paper said. It outlined a need to “slowly correct misunderstandings about going out to choose jobs.""Before Uighurs were transferred for jobs, the paper continued, they needed to be trained and assessed on their living habits and adoption of corporate culture.“Those who fail will not be exported,"" it said.The paper also described government incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies for Chinese companies to take Uighurs. A 2014 draft contract for Xinjiang laborers in Guangdong province obtained by the AP shows the government there offered companies 3000 RMB ($428.52) per worker, with an additional 1000 RMB ($142.84) for “training"" each person for no less than 60 class hours. In exchange, companies had to offer “concentrated accommodation areas,"" halal canteens and “ethnic unity education and training.""But it was a tough sell at a time when Chinese officials were grappling with knifings, bombings and car attacks by Uighurs, fueled by explosive anger at the government’s harsh security measures and religious restrictions. Hundreds died in race-related violence in Xinjiang, both Uighur and Han Chinese.A labor agent who only gave his surname, Zhang, said he tried brokering deals to send Xinjiang workers to factories in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but finding companies willing to take Uighurs was a challenge, especially in a slowing economy.""Their work efficiency is not high,"" he said.The size of the program is considerable. A November 2017 state media report said Hotan prefecture alone planned to send 20,000 people over two years to work in inner China.There, the report said, they would “realize the dreams of their lives.""___ANSWERING THE GOVERNMENT’S CALLThe Uighurs at OFLIM were sent there as part of the government’s labor program, in an arrangement the company’s website calls a “school-enterprise cooperative."" OFILM describes the workers as migrants organized by the government or vocational school students on “internships"".OFILM confirmed it received AP requests for comment but did not reply.The AP was unable to get inside the facility, and on one visit to Nanchang, plainclothes police tailed AP journalists by car and on foot. But posts on the company website extoll OFILM’s efforts to accommodate their Uighur workers with Mandarin and politics classes six days a week, along with halal food.OFILM first hired Uighurs in 2017, recruiting over 3,000 young men and women in Xinjiang. They bring the Uighurs on one- or two-year contracts to Nanchang, a southeastern metropolis nearly two thousand miles from Xinjiang that local officials hope to turn into a tech hub.OFILM is one of Nanchang’s biggest employers, with half a dozen factory complexes sprinkled across the city and close ties with the state. Investment funds backed by the Nanchang city government own large stakes in OFILM, corporate filings show. The Nanchang government told the AP that OFILM recruits minorities according to “voluntary selection by both parties"" and provides equal pay along with personal and religious freedom.OFILM’s website says the company “answered the government’s call"" and went to Xinjiang to recruit minorities. The Uighurs need training, OFILM says, to pull them from poverty and help them “study and improve.""Mandarin is heavily emphasized, the site says, as well as lessons in history and “ethnic unity"" to “comprehensively improve their overall quality."" The site features pictures of Uighurs playing basketball on factory grounds, dancing in a canteen and vying in a Mandarin speech competition.In August, when OFILM organized celebrations for Eid Qurban, a major Islamic festival, Uighur employees did not pray at a mosque. Instead, they dressed in orange uniforms and gathered in a basketball court for a show with Communist officials called “Love the Motherland – Thank the Party."" An OFILM post said a “Uighur beauty"" dazzled with her “beautiful exotic style.""State media reports portray the Nanchang factory workers as rural and backwards before the Communist Party trained them, a common perception of the Uighurs among the Han Chinese.“The workers’ concept of time was hazy, they would sleep in till whenever they wanted,"" a Party official is quoted as saying in one. Now, he said, their “concept of time has undergone a total reversal.""In the reports and OFILM posts, the Uighurs are portrayed as grateful to the Communist Party for sending them to inner China.Despite the wan expressions of three OFILM workers from Lop County, a December 2017 report said they gave an “enthusiastic"" presentation about how they lived in clean new dormitories “much better than home"" and were visited by Communist Party cadres.“We were overjoyed that leaders from the Lop County government still come to see us on holidays,"" one of the workers, Estullah Ali, was quoted as saying. “Many of us were moved to tears.""___THEY TOOK MY CHILD TO INNER CHINAMinorities fleeing China describe a far grimmer situation. H., a wealthy jade merchant from Lop County, where OFILM now gets Uighur workers, began noticing the labor transfer program in 2014. That’s when state propaganda blaring through television and loudspeakers urged young Uighurs to work in inner China. Officials hustled families to a labor transfer office where they were forced to sign contracts, under threat of land confiscations and prison sentences.H., identified only by the initial of his last name out of fear of retribution, was worried. The government was not only reviving the labor program but also clamping down on religion. Acquaintances vanished: Devout Muslims and language teachers, men with beards, women with headscarves.Toward the end of 2015, when H. greeted his 72-year-old neighbor on the street, the man burst into tears.“They took my child to inner China to work,"" he said.Months later, H. and his family fled China.Zharqynbek Otan, a Chinese-born ethnic Kazakh, said that after he was released from an internment camp in 2018, neighbors in his home village also told him their sons and daughters were forced to sign contracts for 6 months to five years to work at factories near Shanghai. If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they’d be taken straight back to internment camps.Nurlan Kokteubai, an ethnic Kazakh, said during his time in an internment camp, a cadre told him they selected young, strong people to work in inner Chinese factories in need of labor.“He told us that those young people would acquire vocational skills,"" Kokteubai said.Not all workers are subject to the restrictions at OFILM. One ethnic Kazakh said her brother made power banks in central China for $571.36 a month and didn’t take classes.But another said two of his cousins were forced to go and work in cold, harsh conditions. They were promised $428.52 a month but paid only $42.85. Though they wanted to quit, four Uighurs who complained were detained in camps after returning to Xinjiang, scaring others.Uighurs and Kazakhs in exile say it’s likely those working in inner China are still better off than those in camps or factories in Xinjiang, and that in the past, some had gone voluntarily to earn money. A former worker at Jiangxi Lianchuang Electronics, a lens maker in Nanchang, told The Associated Press the 300 or so Uighurs there were free to enter or leave their compound, although most live in dormitories inside factory grounds. He and a current worker said they were happy with their working conditions, their salary of about 5,000 RMB ($714.20) a month, and their teachers and Mandarin classes in the evenings.But when presented a list of questions in Uighur about the labor transfers, the former Jiangxi Lianchuang worker started to look very nervous. He asked for the list, then set it on fire with a lighter and dropped it in an ashtray.“If the Communist Party hears this, then"" – he knocked his wrists together, mimicking a suspect being handcuffed. “It’s very bad.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

HMD Global, the Finnish company that owns the licence to make and sell Nokia phones, has tied up with the producers of Bond movies to feature the first 5G-ready Nokia smartphone expected to be launched on 19 March.  The release of the movie, which was earlier scheduled in April, has been deferred to November 2020 due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak.This is not the first time when a phone company has marketed its flagship handset through famous stars in action movies.In another Bond movie Casino Royale that hit the theaters in 2006, Craig used Sony’s CyberShot phone K800i to click photos. In Skyfall (2012), Craig used a Sony smartphone- 4.6-inch screen Xperia T.Nokia’s first touchscreen phone XpressMedia 5800 appeared in the 2008 movie The Dark Knight from the Batman series, where Morgan Freeman’s character Lucius Fox gave the handset to Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne. Nokia 8110, a slide out feature phone from the 1990s, was one of the first smartphones to feature in an action movie. In the 1999 movie The Matrix, Laurence Fishburne’s character Morpheus sends Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, a Nokia 8110 to give instructions.Marvel’s Iron Man series has featured phones by LG and Alcatel.

13,Bombay HC dismisses plea by Chanda Kochhar against ICICI Bank,"Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by Chanda Kochhar against ICICI Bank Ltd for her termination as managing director and chief executive of the lender. The bench, comprising Justices NM Jamdar and MS Karnik, agreed with the contentions raised by the bank and ruled that ICICI Bank Ltd was a private body and not part of writ jurisdiction.""It is not an instrumentality of the State. It receives no public funding. Service conditions of the Petitioner are not governed by any statute. The dispute raised in this Petition arises from a contract of personal service. The termination of the Petitioner is in the realm of contractual relationship,"" the high court said.The bank had argued that the petition was not maintainable as writ petition because there is no public cause in this case and the action to remove Kochhar was part of private contractual terms.""It performs no public duty. There is no public law element in its functioning. It is only a private bank having a purely private character,"" senior counsel Darius Khambatta said, arguing in favour of the bank.The former banker and ex-employee of ICICI Bank had moved the court on 30 November seeking remedy against her removal when the board had already accepted her early retirement plea.She said her retirement request was accepted by the bank in October 2018, and in February 2019, the bank issued her a termination letter. Kochhar, in her petition, challenged the ‘purported termination’ and denial of the agreed remuneration.The petition, had also termed the termination of her services by the bank as contravention of law on the ground that it was without previous approval of the RBI, as Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 requires prior approval of the the central bank before terminating the services of a managing director of a bank.In the first week of December the bank had produced the RBI approval letter in the court which led to Kochhar filing an amended plea.India's second largest bank had decided to terminate the service of ex-banker after a committee, led by Justice BN Srikrishna, found that Videocon Industries was granted loans by ICICI Bank and, in quid pro quo, Videocon invested in Nupower Renewables, the company owned by Kochhar’s husband.While the committee indicted Chanda Kochhar, the board terminated her employment earlier this year, after taking into consideration the enquiry report submitted by Justice Srikrishna.The board also informed Kochhar that it decided to treat her separation from the bank as ‘termination for cause’ under the internal policies and also required clawback of the entire amount of bonus of  ₹7.42 crore paid to her from April 2009 until March 2018."
14,"Coronavirus update: Iran virus deaths rise to 107 amid 3,513 confirmed cases","DUBAI,		             UAE :Iran will set up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and urged citizens on Thursday to reduce their use of paper money to fight a spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed at least 107 people across the Islamic Republic. The announcement in Iran came as Palestinian authorities said the storied Nativity Church in the biblical city of Bethlehem, built atop the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born, will close indefinitely later in the day over coronavirus fears.These mark the latest disruptions of life across the Mideast from the new virus, which has seen over 3,740 confirmed cases.Iran's Health Minister Saeed Namaki announced his country's new restrictions at a televised press conference. He added that schools and universities will remain closed through Nowruz, the Persian New Year, on 20 March.He said people should stay in their vehicles at gas stations and allow attendants to fill their gas tanks to avoid the spread of the virus.Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside of China.The Palestinian Health Ministry meanwhile said it was preventing all tourists from entering the West Bank. The ministry did not specify for how long. Most tourists to the West Bank visit the biblical city of Bethlehem, where the Nativity Church is located, and Jericho.The measures comes after suspicions that four Palestinians had caught the new coronavirus. A Palestinian official said the four had tested positive for the virus but that the tests were sent to Israel to verify the results. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the issue with the media. They would be the Palestinian territories' first cases if confirmed.The Palestinian Health Ministry also said churches and places of worship in Bethlehem will be closed for two weeks.Earlier Thursday, the United Arab Emirates warned its citizens and its foreign residents not to travel anywhere abroad amid the ongoing worldwide coronavirus outbreak, a stark warning for a country home to two major long-haul airlines.The country's Health and Community Protection Ministry warning comes as its capital, Abu Dhabi, sent 215 foreigners it evacuated from hard-hit Hubei in China to a quarantine set up in its Emirates Humanitarian City. They include citizens of Egypt, Sudan and Yemen.Health officials warned that those traveling abroad could face quarantine themselves at the discretion of authorities. The UAE is home to some 9 million people, with only about 1 million estimated to be Emirati citizens.The UAE is home to Emirates, the government-owned airline based at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel. Abu Dhabi also is home to Etihad, the country's national carrier. Both airlines have encouraged staff to take time off as international travel has dropped due to the virus.The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted Islamic worship in the Middle East, as Saudi Arabia on Wednesday banned its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, while Iran canceled Friday prayers in major cities."
15,Japan committed to hosting Olympics on schedule even as coronavirus spreads,"TOKYO: Japan's Olympics minister signalled the Summer Games would go ahead as planned from July even as the coronavirus outbreak spread to new parts of the country. ""Based on the fact that the IOC never mentioned about cancelling or postponing the Tokyo Games at its meeting yesterday, I don't expect a cancellation notice or anything of that sort,"" Seiko Hashimoto said in parliament on Thursday.The minister had caused controversy earlier this week by saying the contract for the games ""could be interpreted as allowing a postponement"" within calendar 2020.Japan's western prefecture of Shiga reported its first coronavirus infection on Thursday, a day after the announcement of a first case in the southern prefecture of Miyazaki.National broadcaster NHK also reported new coronavirus infections in Kyoto, Sapporo and Niigata.Confirmed cases had risen to 1,036 nationwide as of Thursday morning, 36 more than the previous day, according to NHK. That was the biggest one-day increase to date.The rapid spread of the virus has raised questions about whether Tokyo can host the Olympics as scheduled from July 24, with the effects being felt by other sporting events.On Wednesday, the Japanese Rugby Football Union announced that next month's Asia Sevens Invitational, which doubles as a test event for rugby sevens at the Tokyo Olympics, has been cancelled due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.The Tokyo marathon was held this month without the participation of non-elite runners, and with fewer volunteers and spectators.Twelve people have died from the disease in Japan, according to the health ministry.Hashimoto told the upper house on Thursday that organisers and the IOC would continue to work together closely, and reiterated the final decision on holding the games as planned rests with the IOC.""Cancellation or delay of the Games would be unacceptable for the athletes,"" Hashimoto said. ""An environment where athletes can feel at ease and focus should be firmly prepared.""Under the host city contract, the IOC has the right to terminate the contract if it has reasonable grounds to believe the safety of the Games would be seriously threatened.But IOC head Thomas Bach on Wednesday voiced confidence the Games would go ahead, saying organisers were receiving expert information from the World Health Organization and others and that the words ""postponement"" and ""cancellation"" had not been mentioned at the IOC's executive board meeting.Some Tokyo residents, however, expressed concerns.“I think the Olympics should be cancelled in this case because it is a dangerous situation,"" 77-year-old Yufumi Tamaki told Reuters on Thursday. ""I feel sorry for the athletes and the people who have prepared for the Games, but it is more important to save lives.""Organizers have made provisions to cancel Tokyo 2020 in the event of a massive earthquake or other natural disaster, Japan's Mainichi newspaper reported.

16,"Coronavirus in India: 80% patients will recover on their own, claim scientists","New Delhi: Four of five people who have tested positive for coronavirus will get better on their own and there is no need for Indians to panic about the viral outbreak yet, says a leading Indian researcher and scientist. Testing for the disease should also be done only when recommended, said Gagandeep Kang as the number of coronavirus cases in India rose to 30, including 16 Italian tourists as well as three patients in Kerala who have recovered.""Please let public health authorities know about exposure to known infected persons or travel to areas where infections are known to be prevalent,"" the Christian Medical College professor, who last year became the first Indian woman to be elected fellow of the Royal Society in London, told PTI in an interview.Noting that all treatments are not curative but only supportive at the moment, she said four of five people will get better on their own and may need nothing more than drugs like paracetamol for fever and cough.""The fifth person may need to see a doctor or be hospitalised. If you have breathing difficulty, you should see a doctor as soon as possible,"" said Kang, also vice-chair of the Norway-based International Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) that aims to derail epidemics by speeding up the development of vaccines.""For everyone, there is no need to worry too much or panic. We are exposed to viruses every day. Make sure you wash your hands well, wipe down or use disinfectants on surfaces. Avoid touching your face,"" she said.The coronavirus (CoV) is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes. COVID-19 that has killed over 3,000 people worldwide and infected more than 90,000 is a novel strain not seen before.Over 53,000 people have recovered from the infection globally, according to an interactive map compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.The World Health Organisation has already declared the outbreak a ""global emergency"", stopping short of terming it a pandemic.Nose and throat swabs are used as specimens for detecting the coronavirus.The test takes at least 12-24 hours for the confirmation. It a gene-based assay called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a more sensitive form called reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR).According to Kang, known for her inter-disciplinary research studying the transmission, development and prevention of intestinal infections, there are still more cases of flu in India and around the world than of the COVID-19.""This is important to know and understand. It looks like this infection causes diseases that are more severe than the flu, but less severe than Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"" she said.SARS is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).At the moment, it seems that COVID-19, unlike the flu, does not cause severe disease in children.""It does, however, cause more severe disease in the elderly, and in people who have cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes,"" said Kang, who was awarded the prestigious Infosys Prize in Life Sciences in 2016.She said many drugs against the viral infection are being tested, including vaccines which may be ready by next year.""There are currently no vaccines, but there are many in development. If all goes well with vaccine development efforts we might have a vaccine next year. But vaccine candidates do not always succeed,"" she said.Kang emphasised that people must inform public health authorities if they suspect they have been exposed to the virus.She also advised people to work from home if they have a fever and a cough.""Stay six-10 feet away from people who are coughing or sneezing,"" she said.""Remember that with most respiratory viruses, most people exposed and sick with relatively minor symptoms recover and have some protection against reinfection,"" she said.Kang added that with the novel coronavirus, getting infected does not mean that every infected person will be severely ill.The scientist is also executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institution of the Department of Biotechnology.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

17,Twitter stories a reality soon? App begins testing disappearing tweets called Fleets,"San Francisco: Taking inspiration from Snapchat ""Stories"", Twitter has started testing its own version of disappearing posts called ""Fleets"". The test confirms that Twitter has become the latest major social media platform to take a liking for disappearing posts first popularised by Snapchat.The test of ""Fleets"" began in Brazil on Wednesday, Twitter said, adding that it started testing the new way of having conversations as some people feel insecure to tweet because the posts are public, permanent and exhibit public engagement counts -- likes and retweets.If the test yields the desired results, Twitter plans to make Fleets available in other countries as well.""We want to make it possible for you to have conversations on the platform in new ways, with less pressure and more control, in addition to Tweets and Direct Messages (Dms),"" Mo Al Adham, a Twitter group product manager said in a blog post.""This is the reason why we will test, starting today in Brazil, a new feature called Fleets, a way to have conversations initiated with your fleeting thoughts,"" he wrote.The 'Fleets' disappear after 24 hours and and they have no retweets, likes or public comments.""In an initial survey, people told us that, once the Fleets are gone, they are more comfortable sharing everyday and everyday thoughts.

18,"Coronavirus update: Existing health policies cover COVID-19, says GIC","MUMBAI :The General Insurance Council, the apex industry lobby of the 44-member strong non-life insurers, on Thursday said almost all health insurance policies cover epidemics, including coronavirus. The statement comes after the regulator Irdai on Wednesday asked insurers to cover coronavirus cases in their existing policies and also to ensure that they expeditiously attend to the coronavirus claims.""Almost all the existing health policies cover almost all epidemics, which includes the coronavirus too. What the regulator (Irdai) said was not to frame a new policy but asking the industry to treat coronavirus cases expeditiously,"" A.V. Girija Kumar, chairman of the General Insurance Council, told PTI here on the sidelines of an industry event to launch an awareness campaign to increase adoption of general insurance policies.There are 30 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in the country as of Thursday, of which 16 are Italian tourists.On Wednesday, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) asked insurers to expeditiously settle hospitalisation claims related to coronavirus disease under health policies. It also instructed insurers to come out with policies to cover treatment costs for coronavirus infection, which has impacted thousands of people worldwide.""For the purpose of meeting health insurance requirements of various sections, insurers are advised to design products covering the costs of treatment for coronavirus,"" Irdai said in a circular.He said the campaign is funded by the 44-strong industry — 25 general insurance companies, six standalone health insurance and two specialised insurance companies, along with 11 reinsurers — to drive awareness about the importance of non-life insurance.Kumar, who is also chairman of the state-run Oriental Insurance Company Ltd, said the industry is on course to close the current financial year at  ₹2 trillion and the industry is eyeing to double the size to  ₹4 trillion by 2024-25.He also said the industry has set a target of increasing the adoption of non-life insurance policies to 2.5 % from the current 1 % by 2029-30.He said that over the past two decades — since the privatisation of the industry — the non-life insurance industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 17 % and the premium is expected to be  ₹2 trillion this year, up from about  ₹10,000 crore in 2000-01.Though the penetration in this period has increased from about 0.5% of gross domestic product (in 2000) to around 1% now, this is far below the penetration of 1.85% and 2.8 % in Asia and globally, respectively. According to the latest Irdai data, only about 4.2 crore individuals have a retail health policy, leaving out-of-pocket spends at about 65% as compared to global average of 18 %. "

21,Godrej Properties to raise  ₹2000 crore debt to buy land in next one year,"Mumbai: Real estate firm Godrej Properties Ltd, which has been on land buying spree over the last two years, plans to further invest in land parcels seizing opportunity of the falling land prices across major cities amid the slowdown. The Godrej group firm plans to raise around  ₹2000 crore through debt to fund land acquisitions in the next one year. The strategy is in line with its overall target to buy land worth around  ₹5000 crore in the next few years, said a top company official.""We raised about  ₹3100 crore of equity earlier this financial year and previous financial year with clear understanding that it would be fully used to acquire new land opportunities. In addition, we are quite comfortable on taking on debt given our attractive borrowing costs,"" Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairman, Godrej Properties told Mint.The company doesn't plan to raise fund through equity, he said adding that the additional  ₹2000 crore would be raised only through debt.Godrej said in the last two years the company has signed land deals worth around  ₹3000 crore either through outright purchase or in partnership with other developers.In financial year 2019-2020, Godrej Properties inked seven new land deals across Mumbai, Bengaluru and the National Capital Region (NCR) spanning over 16.78 million sq ft of space. In the previous financial year alone, the company added 30 million sq ft of new projects to its portfolio.Godrej Properties' latest big acquisition was a  ₹1300-crore purchase of 26.58 acre of land from the Railway Land Development Authority at New Delhi's Ashok Vihar. It plans to build a new 3.28 million-sq ft residential project over the land. Last year, the company also bought Mumbai marquee property RK studio over which it is currently developing a luxury housing project.Last week, Godrej Properties announced purchasing a prime 3 acre land plot at Mumbai's Powai area for around  ₹153 crore.According to him, land prices have fallen by 10-15% in some of the markets with NCR seeing the sharpest fall by around 30% over the last two years.""In a long cycle business like real estate we don't think it makes sense to be chasing after land when every developer is looking to buy. Land prices can tend to get stretched. In a moment when there are not too many buyers and there is a liquidity issue, we think there is reasonable valuation and favorable terms.available in the market. So we do think that this counter cyclical investments make a lot of sense,"" Godrej said.According to the credit rating agency India Ratings and Research (IndRA), share of top ten listed real estate firms have almost doubled to 13% in FY20 from 6% in FY 2017.""In a market environment where NBFCs are de-growing their books and many traditional developers monetising land assets to reduce debt, Godrej Properties has placed themselves well to ride the consolidation story that will unfold big time in the next few quarters,"" Nishant Kabra, Senior Director, JLL India, a property consultancy firm."
22,Does Yes Bank’s rescue need to be a community project?,"It takes a village to raise a child. It seems it may well take some of India’s largest banks and its biggest life insurance company to lift Yes Bank Ltd out of its misery. Multiple news reports suggest that the government is pushing for a bailout of the private bank, which will be led by the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), possibly with some help from Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). But some reports suggest this involve generous contributions by other large private lenders who will be part of a consortium that is tasked with rescuing the bank.The beleaguered lender needs between  ₹15,000 crore and  ₹18,000 crore in the next one year to meet regulatory minimum capital ratios, says an analyst at a multinational brokerage, requesting anonymity. This requirement could well be different, as the lender hasn’t made public its balance sheet as of the December quarter.Any plan to make a clutch of banks to come to Yes Bank’s rescue makes sense. Firstly, the cost of a failure at Yes Bank will be borne by the entire financial system, so it seems fair that SBI alone isn’t carrying the cost of the rescue.If several banks come together to save the private lender from sinking, it shows solidarity to prevent a systemic shock. Also, when Yes Bank begins to strengthen after a thorough clean up, the investors could well end up making money, says a former mutual fund manager.Another positive outcome from such a move is that prospective investors would get confidence to put money in Yes Bank knowing that marque lenders are behind it. Likewise, worried depositors’ nerves would also be soothed, which will also help repair the banks’ books.But clearly all this is easier said than done.As per regulatory rules, an Indian bank cannot hold more than 5% in another bank’s equity without the explicit permission of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The hope is that the RBI would fall back on its leeway clause that says it can give relaxation a “case to case basis"".Another hurdle to cross is the cost of the acquisition. According to Macquarie Capital, Yes Bank’s networth is nil if one considers the potential slippage of its entire troubled BB and below rated loan book.A community of bankers, if willing to lend Yes Bank a hand, would want it cost as little as possible. That would mean that Yes Bank’s equity investors would need to be prepared for a huge write-off on their investment. The bank’s market capitalisation rose to over Rs9000 crore, after an over 20% surge in the stock today on the bailout news."
23,"Taxation of dividends, back to classical system","It’s almost a month since the Union budget was presented and by now taxpayers and other stakeholders have gone through the fine print to understand the implications of various announcements. While some proposals brought cheer to taxpayers, certain other proposals are a mixed bag. One such budget announcement which has brought relief to taxpayers is the proposal to abolish the dividend distribution tax (DDT) payable by Indian companies and restoring the classical system of taxing dividends in the shareholders’ hands. This was a much-awaited move and a constant demand by various stakeholders. Taxability of dividends till FY20Currently, Indian companies are required to pay DDT on the dividends declared, distributed or paid to shareholders at the rate of 15% plus applicable surcharge and cess taking the effective rate to 20.6%At present, the dividends are not subject to tax in the hands of the shareholders, except for certain category of resident taxpayers where dividend income exceeding  ₹10 lakh attracts an additional tax at the rate of 10% under section 115BBDA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act). This category comprises resident shareholders other than a domestic company, i.e. individuals, Hindu undivided family, association of persons (AOP) and body of individuals (BOI), partnership firm or an LLP. It is pertinent to note that resident corporate shareholders, foreign companies and non-residents are not subject to pay this additional tax of 10% on dividends received from Indian companies.Even after the concessional tax rates introduced by the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, the total levy of corporate tax, including DDT, took the effective tax rate to about 45%, which is arrived at by adding the effective concessional corporate tax rate of 25.2% (i.e. 22% plus applicable surcharge and education cess) and effective DDT at the rate of 20.6% (i.e. 15% on grossed up basis). The effective tax rate of 45% was high as compared to other countries and India was seen to be gradually losing its competitive edge, especially from a foreign investment perspective.Post deletion of DDT, dividend income will be taxed in the hands of all shareholders at applicable tax rates. The impact of these changes for resident and non-resident shareholders are discussed in the ensuing paragraphs.Impact on resident shareholdersResident individual taxpayers, Trusts, etc., falling under the highest slab and with income above  ₹5 crore who are subject to the maximum rate of 30% (plus surcharge at 37% and cess at 4%) with an effective tax rate of 42.7%, stand to forgo more tax on the dividends now.Earlier, the effective tax rate on their dividend income was 34.8% [i.e. DDT at 20.6% plus income tax at 14.2% (ie. tax at 10% plus surcharge at 37% and education cess at 4%) under section 115BBDA].On the other side, resident individual taxpayers falling under the lowest slab who are subject to tax at the effective tax rate of 10.4% (10% plus education cess at 4%) stand to gain from the new regime, with lower tax outgo.Similarly, Indian firms and LLPs will also be liable to tax on the entire dividend income resulting in higher tax outflow under the new dividend taxation regime. Under the earlier regime, they were subject to tax at an effective rate of 32.20% [DDT at 20.6% plus tax at 11.60% (10% plus surcharge at 12% and education cess at 4%) under section 115BBDA], whereas under the new regime they will have to forgo tax at 34.90% (tax rate of 30% plus surcharge at 12% and education cess at 4%).The resident corporate shareholder may also be at a loss as under the earlier regime the company declaring dividend was required to pay DDT at 20.60% whereas under the proposed regime the corporate shareholder opting for the new concessional tax rate under section 115BAA of the Act will be liable to pay tax at 25.20% on the dividend income. However, the Budget also proposes to eliminate the cascading tax effect in case of inter-corporate dividends by providing a deduction under section 80M in respect of dividends received by a domestic company to the extent such dividend is distributed to its shareholders. Such deduction shall be allowed only if the dividend is distributed by the company at least one month prior to due date of filing of return of income.Deduction for interest on borrowings taken for investments on which dividend income is being earned shall be restricted to 20 per cent of dividend income. Only resident shareholders would be eligible for this deduction and no other deductions would be allowed to the shareholder against dividend incomeIt is pertinent to note that the dividend paid to resident shareholders will be subject to tax withholding at the rate of 10% on dividend above `5,000.Impact on NRI shareholdersThe key beneficiaries of the proposed amendment are likely to be foreign companies and non-residents who receive dividend income from Indian companies. This is due to the fact that the tax treaties with most of the countries limit the taxation on dividends between 5% to 15%. Thus, companies in the US, Mauritius, Singapore, etc., who have subsidiaries in India and are eligible to avail the benefit under the tax treaties would be major beneficiaries.The Indian company distributing dividend would be liable to withhold taxes at 21.84% (i.e. tax rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge and cess) on payment of dividend to a non-resident shareholder. However, this rate could be lower if the benefit under the tax treaty is availed by the non-resident taxpayer/shareholder. Further, foreign shareholders may get credit in their home country for the taxes paid in India. Although, the proposed amendment would boost the sentiment of foreign investors, it will increase compliance burden for them as they will have to file income tax return in India if they avail tax treaty benefit. In the earlier DDT framework, the non-resident investors were not able to claim a tax credit with respect to the DDT paid by Indian companies.The other side of the coinIt appears an unintended fall out of this change in tax regime is on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Investment Infrastructure Trust (InvITs). With deletion of DDT and taxation of dividend in the hands of shareholders, the unitholders of InvITs and REITs would be required to pay tax on the dividend income at applicable tax rates plus surcharge and education cess. Under the existing structure, the dividend received and paid by REITs were exempt at all three levels i.e. special purpose vehicles (SPVs) were not required to pay DDT, InvITs and REITs were exempt from tax on dividend received from SPV and unitholders of InvITs and REITs were exempt from paying tax on dividend received. The budget 2020 has shifted the burden of tax on dividend income to investors. While nothing changes for SPVs and the trusts as they still won’t pay tax, unitholders of InvITs and REITs are no longer exempt.We understand that representations have been made to the government to re-consider the tax impact of this proposal on REITs and InvITs and their unit holders.The proposed amendment is a welcome step and aligns the taxability of dividend income with that of other countries. The tax payers need to evaluate the impact of this change on their overall income and tax from dividends.Sidharth Sipani contributed to this article.

24,Shaktikanta Das says RBI to be ‘proactive’ in tackling coronavirus threat,"MUMBAI :The Reserve Bank of India will be proactive in dealing with threats stemming from the coronavirus outbreak and will have assessed the potential impact on India by the next rate decision due April 3, Governor Shaktikanta Das told BloombergQuint. “If required, the RBI will act as and when required and, as in the past, the RBI will be proactive and act in time,"" Das said, when asked if the central bank needs to make an emergency move. His comments come just days after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points in a surprise decision, triggering speculation that other central banks will follow suit.In a report, Deutsche Bank said it saw increased possibility of the RBI delivering an at least 25 basis points rate cut before its April 3 decision.“With the concerns related to growth likely to dominate over inflation in the coming months and quarters, a preemptive move by RBI makes sense, especially given the considerable lag with which monetary policy transmission works in India,"" Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank wrote.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

25,Supplies of the hottest smartphones could soon run out amid pandemic fears,"As Chinese factories hit by the coronavirus look to restart production, the pain is only beginning for carriers that rely on steady shipments of Asian smartphones. AT&T Inc. is bracing for handset shortages across the U.S. A carrier in the U.K. and one in France are already dealing with supply disruption and could run out of some popular models, people familiar with the matter said.British network operators may even resort to using stockpiles of phones they’d built up in case of a Brexit-related supply crunch, said one of the people, a company executive who asked not to be identified as the information is private.The supply chain chaos may last only a few weeks, but it’s already wiping out the smartphone industry’s hopes for sales growth this year.Worldwide device sales are set to fall 4.3% in 2020, with European sales tumbling 7.4%, according to industry consultancy Canalys. It was forecasting global growth of 3.6% before the virus brought much of Chinese industry to a juddering halt.“There’s a huge supply-side shortage for smartphones that we are already starting to see trickle through to some markets around the world,"" said Ben Stanton, head of devices research for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Canalys.He said global handset production was 35% of normal levels in February, will return to 85% this month, and could get back to normal by April. The output slump means it’ll take time to fix delivery backlogs for brands like Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. and Huawei Technologies Co.The Canalys estimates are based on confidential feedback from manufacturers, distributors, carriers and retailers.‘Complex System’About 5 million mobile phones are sold every day. Many of those units take just a few weeks to go from the assembly plant to the consumer in tightly-choreographed arrangements planned months in advance.“The supply chain is a complex system, only as strong as its weakest link, and at present a lot of elements are out of sync,"" said Marina Koytcheva, vice president of forecasting at CCS Insight.CCS cut its forecast for sales of mobile phones outside China in the first six months of the year by 10%. Koytcheva said the industry may face an even bigger problem than supply glitches if virus outbreaks hit phone demand and economic growth across the world.“Judging by the weak demand for smart devices in China in January and February, this is a major concern,"" she said.Carriers are hoping Apple’s first 5G iPhone will boost their revenue by kicking off a new sales cycle and getting customers to upgrade their plans. Doubts about the launch timing are now creeping in, and Stanton said 5G marketing campaigns may need to be delayed.Some Apple products, such as the iPad Pro tablet, have been seeing limited availability at stores in major cities in the U.S., Australia and Europe, according to a review of the company’s website.The virus has led to a “modest tightening"" of iPhone supply over the past two weeks, Loup Ventures, which tracks lead times for Apple products, said on its website on Wednesday. Apple has said the supply shortages will affect its worldwide revenues.At a Morgan Stanley investor conference on Tuesday, AT&T Chief Operating Officer John Stankey said the U.S. carrier faces potential phone shortages.Its rival, Verizon Communications Inc., has seen no material impact from the virus response, but it’s still early, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said at the same event. If disruption continues, “I think we’ll see a more material impact on our equipment revenue line,"" he added.Carriers can’t even raise prices to make up for lower unit sales as they’re locked into agreements with manufacturers to sell the devices at set values, said Stanton at Canalys.“March is going to be the big month of challenge, and it may well extend into April as well,"" he said. “There’s not a lot they can do at this stage.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

All these patients are now being treated in Delhi. "
29,How the black caps hurt Kohli,"Virat Kohli and his band of bearded men might have suffered an ignominious whitewash in the test series in New Zealand, but they remain in the fray as the best touring side that India has produced in the last three decades. Just about. They have compiled this record more on the strength of their bowling, rather than their batting, which has demonstrated a familiar fragility at key moments. Since 1990, four players have had a decent run as Indian captain in tests: in chronological order, Mohammad Azharuddin, Sourav Ganguly, MS Dhoni and, now, Virat Kohli. Each has also led sides to all four SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia), which are sterner cricketing examinations for all touring teams.Among the four captains, Virat Kohli has the record for the highest winning percentage in all overseas tests (45%), followed by Ganguly (39%). Even in SENA countries, the pecking order remains the same. However, the winning percentage for both captains in SENA countries (25% and 17%, respectively) dips significantly compared to their overall away records.One difference in approach between the two captains has been playing for the draw. With Kohli’s sides, the result in away matches has usually been a binary: win or lose. By comparison, Ganguly’s sides created fewer wins than Kohli’s, but they drew more matches. As a result, in SENA countries, while Kohli has a win/draw percentage of 38%, the same for Ganguly’s sides is 58%. In other words, even in the most difficult of conditions, Ganguly’s side was not losing in three out of five matches.MS Dhoni, under whom the Indian test side enjoyed 21 months at the pinnacle of test rankings, has an away win percentage of just 20%, almost half that of Ganguly. In fairness, Dhoni’s sides enjoyed fewer easier tours. Of the 30 matches that Dhoni captained in, 23 were in the four SENA countries—the highest share among these four captains.At an overall level, the Indian away performance has shown small crests and big troughs. There was a barren period under Azharuddin when India did not register even a single win out of 21 tests in SENA countries. Under Ganguly, India found new grit and expression abroad.A combination of improvement in performance and commercial value ensured that India embarked on more plum tours to SENA countries under Dhoni. However, success was elusive. Subsequently, under Kohli, India has remained a top draw for a touring side, and it has won more than it did under Dhoni, including a first-ever series win in Australia last year.The foundation for India’s improvement in away tests, compared to the 1990s, flowed a lot through the batting department. This was especially true of Ganguly’s sides, which comprised batting greats such as Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag.Of the four captains, it’s only under Ganguly that India’s batting average of top- and middle-order batsmen (positions 1 to 7) exceeded 40 in all tests played overseas as well as those played in SENA countries. Also, it’s only Ganguly’s teams whose batting average in SENA countries exceeded their overall away batting average.The additional runs contributed to Ganguly’s teams having greater margin, be it to chase a win or to hold on for a draw. On an overall away basis, Kohli’s teams are behind only Ganguly’s. But in SENA countries, Kohli’s sides have the lowest average of all four captains; and they also see the biggest drop off from their overall away batting average, of about 6 runs per wicket.One part of batting overseas is occupying the crease. In that aspect, Ganguly’s teams again demonstrate greater resilience than the other three sets. Those sides were the only ones where positions 1 to 7 averaged above 80 balls per wicket in away matches, both on an overall basis and in the SENA set. Kohli’s follow with an average of 73 balls per wicket on an overall basis, but this fall precipitously to 64 balls against SENA countries.Despite their inherent batting weaknesses, if Kohli’s sides still have a better overseas winning record than the other three, a lot has to do with their bowling firepower. Overseas, India was always a decent bowling unit. It has become progressively better and now has a formidable pace bowling stock. The average number of balls taken per wicket—or, bowling strike rate—by Indian bowlers has improved consistently, from 92 under Azharuddin to 53 under Kohli .For now, Kohli’s teams are holding on to their mantle of being the most successful Indian test side overseas. But if tours like New Zealand continue that position may not hold.howindialives.com is a database and search engine for public data"

31,The Railways’ uncool ‘coolie’ tweet,"A tweet by the Ministry of Railways has sparked a heated debate on Twitter. Designed to pay tribute to women porters at Indian railway stations ahead of International Women’s Day on 8 March, the tweet ended up offending some of our Twitteratti with its gratuitous use of the term “coolie"". The ministry appears woefully out of touch. It appears not to have realized that the word is distinctly uncool today. It’s derived from a Tamil word for “wages"" that was adopted by the British Raj to describe indentured labourers. For decades, it was what porters were routinely called (recall the Amitabh Bachchan starrer Coolie). Of late, among the woke especially, it has become infra-dig. Maybe this has something to do with the uncivil use of the phrase “cyber-coolie"" once used for the Indian IT coder, signifying a lowly paid worker doing grunt work. Languages change as societies evolve, and if people don’t like being called something, they should not be.It wasn’t just the word that attracted online flak, though. Many believe that India ought to be ashamed of such manual labour, pointing out that having others haul their luggage around smacks of colonial exploitation. This is not an open-and-shut issue. India remains a poverty-stricken country, and women who work as porters are doing so to earn a living. Yes, it reflects poorly on India’s employment scenario. Jobs are so scarce that people are ready to carry other people’s luggage around. But still, hauling a single load off a train to a car waiting outside in a city like Delhi earns as much as a whole day’s wages under India’s rural job guarantee scheme. Why deny anyone these earnings?"
32,ISKON temple asks foreign devotees to 'stay away' amid coronavirus scare,"Mathura: The famous ISKON temple in Mathura has issued an advisory, asking all foreign devotees not to visit the temple for the next two months. The advisory is being circulated through other ISKON temples in other countries.The advisory has been issued in view of the coronavirus outbreak since the maximum number of suspected cases has been found in the neighbouring Agra district.The ISKON temples across the globe, and particularly in Mathura, attract the largest number of Lord Krishna devotees. Run by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the temple is taking extra precaution against the virus.All its staff members have been asked to wear masks and the devotees coming to the temple are being made aware of the precautions needed to guard against Corona virus.According to sources, the ISKON management has asked some foreign devotees camping in the temple complex to educate other foreign devotees about the virus.Meanwhile, the district administration is asking devotees to wear masks and wash their hands frequently.""We cannot stop people from visiting Mathura since this is the peak festive season of Holi and there are already thousands of tourists here. However, we are still asking the various temple managements to create awareness and request the devotees to take preventive measures,"" said a district official.With COVID-19 cases beginning to show an upward trend in the country, the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday updated Parliament over the measures taken by the government to contain the disease. The Minister said that they were fully geared up to battle the virus.He told the Parliament, ""As on March 4, at least 28,529 persons were brought under community surveillance and are being monitored,"" adding ""The Prime Minister is personally monitoring the situation.""

33,"Coronavirus lingering in room, toilet of victims main source of transmission, say experts","WASHINGTON :New research from Singapore published Wednesday showed that patients with the novel coronavirus extensively contaminate their bedrooms and bathrooms, underscoring the need to routinely clean high-touch surfaces, basins and toilet bowls. On the other hand, the virus was killed by twice-a-day cleaning of surfaces and daily cleaning of floors with a commonly used disinfectant, which suggests that current decontamination measures are sufficient as long as people adhere to them.The research letter was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and comes after cases in China where the pathogen spread extensively through hospitals, infecting dozens of health care workers and other patients.This led scientists to believe that, beyond catching the infection through coughing, environmental contamination was an important factor in the disease's transmission, but its extent was unclear.Researchers at Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases and DSO National Laboratories looked at the cases of three patients who were held in isolation rooms between late January and early February.They collected samples from their rooms on five days over a two-week period.The room of one patient was sampled before routine cleaning, while the rooms of the other two patients were sampled after disinfection measures.The patient whose room was sampled before cleaning had the mildest symptoms of the three, only experiencing a cough. The other two had moderate symptoms: both had coughing and fever, one experienced shortness of breath and the other was coughing up lung mucus.Despite this disparity, the patient whose room was sampled before cleaning contaminated 13 of 15 room sites testing, including their chair, bed rail, the glass window of their room, the floor, light switches.Three of the five toilet sites were also contaminated, including the sink, door handle and toilet bowl -- more evidence that stool can be a route of transmission.Air samples tested negative, but swabs taken from air exhaust outlets were positive -- which suggests that virus-laden droplets may be carried by air flows and deposited on vents.""Significant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene,"" the authors wrote.SARS-CoV-R is the official name of the pathogen.The virus, which was first identified in China's Hubei province in December has now infected more than 95,000 people in 81 countries and territories, killing more than 3,200.The World Health Organization said Wednesday the mortality rate was 3.4%, revising upward previous estimates."
34,"Google Play store hides search results for coronavirus, Covid-19","With more than 94,000 cases of the novel coronavirus being detected, rumours about the disease are spreading like wildfire on various social media platforms. And to calm the panic that is increasing all across the world, these speculative information need to be curbed immediately. In order to mitigate the spreading of fake news and misinformation about the virus, Google has removed search results for 'coronavirus' or 'COVID-19' from its Play Store app on Android phones and play.google.com on website. First spotted by 9to5 Google, the report stated that if any user searched for these specified terms, he or she would end up with with a message, ""no results found"" for both Android apps and games. Similar terms — like those appending “tracker"" or “map"" — also do not work. However, the report also stated that Movie, TV show, and book searched seemed to being functioning normally.However, there is a small catch. According to the 9to5 Google report, If you search for information related to coronavirus, you will be able to find results for your searched if the terms are not specific. In other words, terms such as COVID19 without the hyphen, will suggest some results still.Google's move to curb misinformation and fake news spread is a positive mood but not the most pragmatic one. The Play Store does carry a number of official applications on news and insights on the virus and how to protect oneself from it, and the removal of all the apps will risk the authentic apps and information available on the Play Store.Meanwhile, among the approximately 94,000 people detected, the vast majority of them are from China where the outbreak originated. More than 3,200 people have died, but 51,000 have recovered after being treated, as well. In India, currently, there are 30 positive cases detected. "
35,Yes Bank will not be nationalised; SBI board meet concludes,"Yes Bank Ltd will not be nationalised under the government’s plan to bail out the private lender with the help of State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium that would acquire stake in the bank, sources aware of the development said. The SBI-led consortium is unlikely to be part of Yes Bank’s management, they added. TV reports said SBI's board meeting concluded around 3.30 pm today to approve the stake purchase.“State Bank will only hold a stake in Yes Bank on a cash-and-carry basis. The existing management of Yes Bank will continue to run the bank. Yes Bank will not be nationalised,"" one of the persons said.Earlier today, news reports had said the government may ask SBI to lead a consortium that will buy stake in Yes Bank. The public-sector bank has also been authorised to pick other members of the consortium.Yes Bank has been struggling to find investors to raise funds worth $2 billion despite several efforts. The bank has been in trouble since its founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) Rana Kapoor was denied extension by the Reserve Bank of India in 2018 owing to corporate governance issues and under-reporting of bad loans.Kapoor’s term as the bank’s CEO ended in January 2019. Ever since, it has been downhill for the bank, with large bad loans pulling it lower. The bank’s inability to attract a suitor despite a frantic search has only worsened the matters.Mint was the first to report that the government and RBI were considering all options, including an interim bailout of Yes Bank, in case the proposed fundraising was to get more delayed.Yes Bank's collapse could have a systemic impact, leading to a domino effect on interlinked financial institutions and impair growth for the banking sector.In January, SBI's chairman Rajnish Kumar had said Yes Bank ""will not be allowed to fail"" and that “some solutions will emerge"" to steady the private lender. This indicated that something was in the works.Yes Bank's share value has eroded more than 80% in the past one year due to concerns over its asset quality and uncertainty around its efforts to raise capital for growth purpose. Shares of Yes Bank jumped nearly 25.77% to end at  ₹36.85 on the BSE today, while that of SBI settled 1.1% higher at  ₹288.30."
36,Pratt & Whitney ropes in Air India arm to service A320neo engines,"NEW DELHI :Aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney (PW) on Thursday said that it has roped in Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL) to provide maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services for its Indian customers, which include airlines like IndiGo and GoAir. ""AIESL will service PW1100G-JM engines at its facility in Mumbai,"" the company said in a statement.According to PW website, the PW1100G-JM geared turbofan engine powers five aircraft platforms, which include the Airbus A220, the Airbus A320neo family and Embraer E190-E2 that are already in commercial service and the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) and Irkut MC-21 aircraft currently undergoing flight testing.IndiGo and GoAir, which operate A320neo planes, have been facing snags with PW engines that power their aircraft.The two carriers with nearly a fourth of the global fleet of about 585 Airbus A320neo planes, have so far seen 26 cases of PW engine failures related to low pressure turbines (LPTs) out of a total of 56 such cases worldwide.The other engine issues, apart from 'third stage' LPT failures, have mostly been addressed by PW itself.AIESL’s introduction to GTF maintenance will be a phased approach, starting with engine upgrade and module exchange capabilities as immediate support of the GTF fleet in India, the company added.IndiGo and GoAir have been permitted to fly their A320neo planes by Indian aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on the condition that at least one of the two engines on the A320neo aircraft has been modified, until modifications are made to all the faulty P&W engines by May-end.Recently, a senior government official told Mint that IndiGo had 152 modified engines at the end of February and is expected to replace all 212 older engines with modified engines by May-end, thus bringing down chances of on-air snags. IndiGo has 106 A320neo aircraft in its fleet.GoAir, which has 43 A320neo planes in its fleet, is expected to have as many as 67 modified engines in its fleet by March-end, the DGCA official said. The delivery schedule for the remaining engines is awaited, the official added."

The MPs -- Gaurav Gogoi, TN Prathapan, Dean Kuriakose, R Unnithan, Manickam Tagore, Benny Behnan and Gurjeet Singh Aujla -- will remain suspended for the entire session till 3 April.The decision comes two days after the Speaker warned that strict action would be taken against those who troop into the well of the House. The Congress members have been protesting against communal violence in Delhi and demanding resignation of home minister Amit Shah. They  also sought an immediate discussion in both houses of Parliament.Even as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) said the issue of violence in Delhi would be discussed in Lok Sabha on 11 March and in Rajya Sabha on 12 March, opposition leaders, primarily Congress, have been protesting since the beginning of the second half of Budget session on Monday.Birla had called for a meeting of chief of all political parties on Tuesday after disruptions continued, but the intervention by the Speaker did not yield results as Congress MPs continued to bring placards and posters in the Lower House. The Speaker had warned the protesting MPs against carrying placards and posters in the House.Birla had repeatedly warned that action would be taken against all erring parliamentarians who disrupt the functioning of Lok Sabha. A scuffle had also broken out between Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarians."

That's the conclusion of Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department after a dog in quarantine tested weak positive for the virus Feb. 27, Feb. 28 and March 2, using the canine's nasal and oral cavity samples.A unidentified spokesman for the department was quoted in a news release as saying. “There is currently no evidence that pet animals can be a source of infection of COVID-19 or that they become sick.""Scientists suspect the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 that causes the disease originated in bats before passing it on to another species, possibly a small wild mammal, that passed it on to humans. However, experts from the School of Public Health of The University of Hong Kong, the College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences of the City University of Hong Kong and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have unanimously agreed that the dog has a low-level of infection and it is “likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission.""The dog, and another also in quarantine which has tested negative for the virus, will be tested again before being released. The department suggested any pets, including dogs and cats, from households where someone has tested positive for the virus should be put into quarantine.In general, pet owners should maintain good hygiene, including washing hands before and after handling animals, their food and supplies and no kissing them. People who are sick should avoid contact with pets and a veterinarian's advice should be sought if changes in a pet's health conditions are detected.“Apart from maintaining good hygiene practices, pet owners need not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets,"" the spokesman said."
41,Women fund managers outperform men: Morningstar,"A research report released by Morningstar shows that 90% of the assets managed by women fund managers in India outperformed their peers over the past 5 years. This share of outperforming assets stood at 72% over the past 3 years and 78% over the past 1 year. Despite this, only 28 out of the 352 mutual fund managers/co-managers in India are women. As a percentage this is only 8% of the total number of fund managers. The Morningstar data also shows that most of the assets managed by women are in the fixed income (debt) space. 23% of assets in the money market category and and 17% of the assets in the fixed income category are managed by women. This compares to just 9.2% of the total assets in the equity category and 2.9% in the hybrid category being managed by women. However this may be somewhat skewed due to the presence of fund managers with large AUM in the debt space such as Lakshmi Iyer of Kotak Mutual Fund.“The data clearly shows that women outperform men as fund managers. One reason could be that women who do manage to break into this male dominated field have to demonstrate an additional level of competence and talent,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, Director, Fund Research at Morningstar Investment Advisors, India. Morningstar highlighted prominent woman fund managers in its report including Sohini Andani of SBI Mutual Fund, Swati Kulkarni of UTI Mutual Fund and Roshi Jain of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund.""Intuitively, women tend to stick to the strategies they decide and that may be the secret sauce. Women also tend to be risk averse in nature, so these fund managers may not be taking unecessary risks to outperform,"" said Shweta Jain, founder, Investography."
42,"Coronavirus update: New case reported from Ghaziabad, India now has 30 patients","India reported one more case of coronavirus today, taking the total number to 30. A middle-aged man from Ghaziabad has tested positive for novel coronavirus, according to a PTI report. The patient had a history of travelling to Iran, official sources said. Besides, a 16-year-old Indian girl has also tested positive for COVID-19 in Dubai. With this new case, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 30 in the country. 16 Italian tourists tested positive for the deadly COVID-19 on Wednesday.On Monday, Union Health Ministry reported that two more people had tested positive for deadly virus. One of the new cases was detected in the national capital while the other was in Telangana, the government said. ""Both were stable and being closely monitored,"" Union Health Ministry said.The first confirmed case of coronavirus came from Kerala last month where three patients, who had returned from Wuhan in China, were detected.The Union Health Ministry on Thursday asked states to form rapid response teams at district, block and village levels, stating cases of community transmission have been observed.As the number of coronavirus cases increase in India, the government has also decided to screen all international flights and passengers coming into the country, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said. The central government has also made COVID-19 free certificate mandatory for travellers from Italy and South Korea.According to the additional travel advisory issued by the central government, on Thursday, the passengers travelling from Italy and South Korea who want to enter into India will have to present a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.""In addition to visa restrictions already in place, passengers travelling from and having visited Italy or Republic of Korea and desirous of entering India will need a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 from the designated laboratories authorized by the health authorities of these countries,"" the Health Ministry on Thursday said in a statement.5 persons kept in isolation in Srinagar hospitalHealth authorities in Kashmir have kept five persons with a recent history of travelling to coronavirus-affected countries in the isolation ward of the SKIMS hospital here after they showed symptoms of the disease, officials said on Thursday.""We have kept the five persons in the isolation ward at the SKIMS hospital in Soura,"" they said.The officials added that samples of the suspects were collected and sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.Of the five, one had travelled to Thailand while two had been to Iran, they said, adding that the remaining two had a recent travel history to the epicentre of COVID-19 in China's Wuhan.The Jammu and Kashmir administration took several steps on Wednesday as part of its efforts to control the spread of coronavirus, after a sudden spike in the number of positive cases in the country."
43,ITC Vivel appoints Kriti Sanon as  new brand ambassador,"New Delhi: ITC Ltd-owned personal care brand Vivel on Thursday announced the appointment of Bollywood actor Kriti Sanon as its new brand ambassador. The brand has launched a new campaign featuring Sanon for its cooling portfolio of soaps and body washes which has ingredients like mint and cucumber.The campaign film conceptualised by advertising agency Brand David, opens in a busy traffic jam with Sanon as the traffic police officer. She portrays the progressive and confident woman, refusing to succumb to everyday sexist jibes, voicing a befitting quick comeback, even as she continues to keep her cool. The brand message goes beyond beauty to address attitude and behaviour towards women and personifies a nuanced perspective of self-confidence that inspires the protagonist to voice her opinion and handle the situation with wit.Sameer Satpathy, chief executive, personal care products business, ITC Limited said, “Kriti is one of the most dynamic new age Bollywood actors. Vivel with its philosophy of Ab Samjhauta Nahin seeks to inspire women to question the limits they've been conditioned into accepting, challenge status quo and therefore enrich their lives with confidence and fulfilment.""Vivel’s brand proposition Ab Samjhauta Nahin aims to empower and educate women to challenge stereotypes and help enable self-action.

The company claimed that Parvaz – Ab Samjhauta Nahin Feminist Leadership Programme in its third year now has helped more than 40 underprivileged urban poor women in Delhi to graduate and impact lives of more than 50,000 women in their communities."
44,"Opinion | EPFO rate cut: Too little, but just as well","Debt market watchers have been at it for a while now, asking for the interest paid on provident fund savings to be lowered, so that these stop sucking money away from bank deposits, which have paid less and less over the years as the Indian central bank’s policy rates went down. Most of the money that gets put away for retirement in the state-run Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) is a compulsory slice of payrolls, but individuals can top their bit up with voluntary contributions to avail of superior risk-free returns—some 2 percentage points higher than a fixed deposit at a bank. For many, it has been a good escape from the financial repression of inflation taking away almost all of what deposits pay, making it harder for banks to mobilize funds. On Thursday, the Indian government bit the bullet. Or tried to, in its own gingerly fashion. It declared that the EPFO would pay 8.5% for 2019-20, down from 8.65% earlier. This is hardly likely to reduce the eagerness to stuff provident funds with extra cash.But spare a thought for the government. A drastic reduction in that EPFO rate, it may have reckoned, would have risked widespread discontent among contributors. Apart from tax incentives, the high payback it assures is the only reason it enjoys the popularity it does. Millions count on these savings for their old age. The slightest hunch that it won’t add up to much after the ravages of inflation tends to upset employees. And inflation has overshot its promised cap. Cut the EPFO rate too far, and the Centre could acquire the image of a financial repressor."

The suspended AAP councillor was absconding in a murder case during the Delhi riots, has been booked in attempt to murder case during the violence. Tahir Hussain was charged after the body of Ankit Sharma was recovered last week from a drain in northeast Delhi's Jaffrabad. The police said he was absconding since his name cropped up in the case.

47,"World food prices dip in February, cereal outlook up: FAO","ROME :World food prices slipped in February, ending four months of successive increases, driven by falls in prices for vegetable oils, meat and grains, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 180.5 points last month, down 1.0% on January.FAO also slightly upped its forecast for cereal production, predicting a crop totalling some 2.719 billion tonnes in 2019, up from a previous forecast of 2.715 billion and some 2.3% higher than the 2018 crop."
48,"Coronavirus: Gems and jewellery export to Hong Kong, China may fall 70% in March","NEW DELHI: Covid-19 is taking a toll on India’s gems and jewellery exports as shipments to Hong Kong and China are likely to fall 70% year-on-year in March. The Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) on Thursday said a partial closure at factories that buy gems and jewellery from India’s traders “will further produce a loss of $1073 million in the coming months till April 2020 in lieu of reduced exports to the said countries"".This is in addition to the loss of $171.5 million already accounted for after the outbreak of Covid-19 in December, GJEPC said.In the financial year 2019, the two markets together were the number one export destination for India’s gems and jewellery trade.An outbreak of the epidemic in China resulted in disruption of manufacturing and trading activities in the country and has adversely affected India’s exports to the two markets.This is likely to exacerbate, GJEPC said. According to its estimates, by April, exports could further decline by 95% year-on-year. “Since, manufacturing activities in China and trading activities in Hong Kong are highly disrupted and almost closed, therefore, it is estimated that exports to both the countries may decline by 70% in the month of March 2020 and 95% in April 2020,"" the note added.Hong Kong and China are significant export partners for various gem and jewellery products out of India such as cut and polished diamonds. India’s exports of such goods to both the markets are estimated at $11.28 billion or roughly 28.38% share of India’s total export trade of gem and jewellery.India’s export of gems and jewellery was estimated at $39.75 billion in FY2019. Around 40% of the total exports of diamonds amounting $9553 million are exported only to Hong Kong and China. Additionally, 55.22% of the polished Indian diamonds, 41.24% of the silver jewellery, and 48.96% of coloured gemstones from India are exported to these two countries, making the two markets significant trade partners for Indian exporters.The news is especially worrisome for traders in markets such as Surat--the biggest processing hub for diamonds in the world.The Coronavirus outbreak, first detected in China in December, has rapidly spread to several countries across the globe. In the process, it has disrupted supplies out of China that is a large manufacturing hub for industries spanning auto components, electronics, apparel, leather goods, bulk drugs, and gems. India’s exports of gems and jewellery to Hong Kong and China declined by around 16% year-on-year to $1428 million between December 2019 and February 2020 as compared to $1693 million during the same period last year, the note said.The GJEPC had said in February, India’s exports of gems and jewellery products to both the markets combined fell 45% year-on-year compared to a decline of 21.5% in January 2020."
49,Israeli PM urges countrymen to adopt 'Namaste' to greet amid coronavirus scare,"NEW DELHI :Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday urged his countrymen to adopt ""Namaste"" - the Indian way of greeting - instead of the normal handshake as one of the measures to prevent the spread of the deadly Coronavirus. At a press conference following a review meeting to fight the spread of coronavirus, Netanyahu said that several measures will be announced to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a PTI report from Jerusalem said. But some simple measures like avoiding the normal handshake while greeting people may possibly be replaced with other forms of greetings like the Indian 'Namaste,' he is reported to have said.He also demonstrated at the press conference as to how the Indians do 'Namaste' while greeting people, the report said.Incidentally, Sanjay Bhattacharyya, secretary in charge of overseas Indian and consular, passport and visa affairs in the Indian foreign ministry had on 16 February said in a Twitter post suggested something similar to beat COVID-19.""Time to make #namaskar go global! It has deeper significance and in times of #COVID19 its best to switch from physical contact to spiritual bonding,"" he had said in his post.The PTI report said that Netanyahu had told the gathering that ""we are in the middle of a global epidemic"", but Israel has done well as it was quick in taking action to prevent the spread of the virus in the country.Israel has 15 confirmed cases of the deadly virus but no deaths, with some 7,000 others home-quarantined.Israeli Health Minister Yaacov Litzman has announced a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people. The Health Ministry has asked people to refrain from any unnecessary foreign trip. Over 3,200 people have died as a result of the coronavirus worldwide."
50,Coronavirus: What doctors treating Covid-19 in Wuhan say about the deadly virus,"BEIJING :As the new coronavirus epidemic spreads across the globe, experts are turning to findings from China, where it originated, to better understand the disease. Since January, doctors at the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan have been studying the virus whose effects are mostly mild but can occasionally turn deadly. Medical professionals who have been treating and studying Covid-19 patients in Wuhan shared their insights with reporters in Beijing on Wednesday. Here are three observations from the doctors.Incubation and transmissionAnecdotal reports that the novel coronavirus may have a long incubation have stoked fears that carriers can go undetected and unknowingly infect others.Local authorities in another city in Hubei — the same province that Wuhan belongs to — reported on 22 February that a 70-year-old man was infected by the virus but only showed symptoms 27 days later.“From most of the publications right now the median incubation period is five to seven days, with the longest incubation period as 14 days,"" said Du Bin, a member of China’s team of experts overseeing coronavirus treatment. “There’s no data showing that an incubation period longer than 14 days ever existed.""In some patients, the onset of the virus happened very slowly with only a mild fever before their conditions deteriorated rapidly 10 days later, according to Li Haichao, deputy director of the respiratory department at the First Hospital of Peking University.There’s also no evidence so far that people who have recovered and later test positive again for the virus can pass it on to others, according to Du, who is also the director of intensive care unit for internal medicine at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.On Thursday, Chinese media The Paper reported that a man in Wuhan who had recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus died less than a week later from the infection. The report was later removed from the internet.Younger deathsThe coronavirus has a relatively low fatality rate and has largely claimed the lives of older patients with weaker immune systems, or those with pre-exisiting conditions. The deaths of some younger patients have been more difficult to explain.Underlying diseases like hypertension and diabetes, the prolonged used of non-invasive ventilation and high doses of corticosteroids over a long period of time were major factors in those deaths, according to Du. He did not specify the age range he was referring to when speaking of younger patients.Methylprednisolone, an immune-suppressing corticosteroid drug that’s in common use in China for severe cases, has been linked to “prolonged viral shedding"" in earlier studies of MERS, SARS and influenza, according to the World Health Organization.Lessons learnedDu said if he could do it all over again, he would have pushed health care authorities harder to have all ICU staff work together in designated hospitals to better establish best practices for critical care.He also would have been more aggressive in using invasive mechanical ventilation in all patients who showed “clinical deterioration"" in their respiratory failure or low blood oxygen levels -- known as hypoxemia.Planning is the most important aspect of the virus response, according to Du, and countries need to know ahead of time how they are going to handle each patient entering a fever clinic, detect suspected cases, confirm if they have the virus in labs and isolate possible cases.“You must have a plan to provide not only space but also supplies such as personal protective equipment for all the healthcare workers involved,"" he said.Du said it’s true that there is a decreasing number of patients in Hubei and more empty hospital beds, although it’s impossible to rule out the possibility of another spike in cases."
51,Anand Mahindra praises Pune woman who took on bikers riding on footpath,"Days after a viral video with a lady taking on bikers riding on footpaths grabbed headlines, automobile giant Mahindra's Executive Chairman Anand Mahindra praised the woman in the clip. The business honcho posted the video on Twitter and called for the observance of 'International Aunties Day.'

He anticipated that it would accelerate 'work from home' culture and lead to more virtual conferences. It would also lead to less travel, and hence, leave a greener footprint.""The crisis will pass, but I think it’s making the world press a permanent ‘Reset’ button. 1) It’ll accelerate working from home 2) lead to more digital ‘virtual’ conferences 3) More video calls, less meetings. 4) Less air travel, leading to a greener footprint.

52,Delhi court fixes 20 March to hang 2012 gangrape convicts,"New Delhi: The Patiala house court on Thursday issued fresh death warrants against the four convicts in 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder case. They will now be hanged on 20 March. President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday had rejected the mercy plea of Pawan Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the gangrape case. Currently, there’s no plea by any of the convict pending before any court.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to 23 March, the plea filed by Centre and Delhi government against the order to execute the convicts simultaneously.In December 2012, a 23-year-old woman was brutally assaulted and raped by six people in a moving bus in south Delhi, an incident which prompted nationwide protests. She succumbed to her injuries on 29 December at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. Of the six, one was a juvenile who was let off after his sentence, while another committed suicide in prison."
53,"Netflix, Amul, Lifebuoy create topical awareness campaigns around Covid-19","NEW DELHI :As confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases have jumped to 29 in India, a clutch of brands across categories have started creating digital as well as print ads to create awareness around the disease. Video streaming platform Netflix, online food delivery aggregator Zomato, Hindustan Unilever’s Lifebuoy and Amul among others have leveraged public service messaging campaigns. Advertising experts believe given that it is the age of moment marketing, brands find it irresistible to not jump into the conversation. The ideal way to be a part of Coronavirus is to help contain the spread the rumors.“Given that panic spreads faster than the disease, and given also that the best scientists in the world won’t be able to find a targeted treatment / cure for it overnight, brands can help in reducing the spread of panic, find ways to soothe people’s nerves and provide factual counters to fear-mongering rumors,"" said Narayan Devanathan, group executive and strategy officer, Dentsu Aegis Network.Sensing that there’s palpable fear among people, personal hygiene have actively started promoting precautionary tips. Lifebuoy, the hygiene brand from Hindustan Unilever (HUL), has been promoting the use of hand sanitiser to stay away from potential threat of the virus. HUL first released a public service print ad urging people to wash hands frequently using soap, use alcohol based sanitisers, tissues and masks if feeling unwell. It was lauded for its messaging since it mentioned its key competitors such as Lux, Dettol, Santoor and Godrej No 1 in the campaign and asked people to buy any soap they had access to.“We have increased our efforts to ensure that consumers’ hygiene needs are fulfilled. We have also redoubled our efforts to educate consumers about proper hygiene habits as well as providing them with access to products that keep them safe such as Lifebuoy soap, hand sanitisers and home care products like Domex which kill disease-causing germs,"" said HUL spokesperson.Like HUL, RB India owned hygiene brand Dettol and Godrej Protekt have also been using social media platforms to dole out information on precautionary measures.Packaged consumer goods firm Dabur said that it is running a series of awareness campaigns across digital platforms, social media and mainstream media to educate the public about how keep themselves safe from Coronavirus.“Our key healthcare brands such as Dabur Chyawanprash, ImmunoDab and Giloy Ghanwati have been running informative campaigns to drive awareness about staying protected from such illnesses. We are also organising a Q&A session, particularly for mothers, with Ayurvedic doctors on digital media platforms to address their queries regarding Coronavirus and how to keep their families protected from it,"" Dabur India Ltd marketing head-healthcare Mukesh Mishra.Meanwhile, brand categories which are not being directly involved in the prevention of the disease are also taking steps to spread awareness. Dairy brand Amul, for instance, did a topical ad featuring its brand mascot the Amul girl washing hands as the copy read ‘Better saaf than sorry’ a clever wordplay of the phrase. The ad appeared in print as well as brand’s social media handles on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.""Such campaigns have two-fold advantage which includes the social angle on the awareness bit and the brand connect with the current situation. In the past also brands like Dettol /Lifebouy have used similar strategies during such outbreaks and relevance of cleanliness and hygiene even in social events such as the Maha Kumbh. The idea is to bring relevance and stay top of mind,"" said Anita Nayyar, CEO of Havas Media, India and Southeast Asia.Zomato has also been running social media campaigns with a simple text in extremely small size against the red backdrop. Users have to zoom in to read the message which states ‘Germs are tiny. So tiny you can’t see them with your eyes. In fact, there might be millions of them on your fingertips that you see to zoom in to read this. Please wash your hands before eating.’Netflix stuck to its category codes and used popular web series Sex Education screen grab with a subtitle that read ‘You should wash your hands, you detty pig’.“Unless it’s crass or distasteful, there may be no harm done in being part of the conversation. Far better actually would be to do something useful in the situation, if you’re not a brand in the health and hygiene category,"" Dentsu’s Devanathan added.Lata Jha contributed to this story "

55,Coronavirus app coming soon: Check whether you are at risk based on your symptoms,"New York: Researchers including one of Indian-origin are developing a coronavirus app that would soon enable people to get an at-home risk assessment based on how they feel and where they have been in about a minute, and direct those deemed at risk to the nearest definitive testing facility. The researchers believe that the app should be available within a few weeks and will be free because it addresses a public health concern.It will also help provide local and public health officials with real time information on emerging demographics of those most at risk for coronavirus so they can better target prevention and treatment initiatives, according to a study published in the journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology.""We wanted to help identify people who are at high risk for coronavirus, help expedite their access to screening and to medical care and reduce spread of this infectious disease,"" said one of the study authors Arni S.R. Srinivasa Rao from Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University in the US.The app will ask individuals where they live; other demographics like gender, age and race; and about recent contact with an individual known to have coronavirus or who has travelled to areas, like Italy and China, with a relatively high incidence of the viral infection in the last 14 days.It will also ask about common symptoms of infection and their duration including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sputum production, headache, diarrhoea and pneumonia.It will also enable collection of similar information for those who live with the individual but who cannot fill out their own survey.Artificial intelligence will then use an algorithm Rao developed to rapidly assess the individual's information, send them a risk assessment — no risk, minimal risk, moderate or high risk — and alert the nearest facility with testing ability that a health check is likely needed.If the patient is unable to travel, the nearest facility will be notified of the need for a mobile health check and possible remote testing.The collective information of many individuals will aid rapid and accurate identification of geographic regions, including cities, counties, towns and villages, where the virus is circulating, and the relative risk in that region so health care facilities and providers can better prepare resources that may be needed, Rao said.It also will help investigators learn more about how the virus is spreading, the investigators from Medical College of Georgia said.Once the app is ready, it will live on the augusta.edu domain and likely in app stores on the iOS and Android platforms, according to Medical College of Georgia.The investigators hope this readily available method to assess an individual's risk will actually help quell any developing panic or undue concern over coronavirus, or COVID-19.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

59,Huawei claims coronavirus hampering trade-secrets case defense,"Huawei Technologies Co. says coronavirus is making it harder to defend itself against a U.S. racketeering and trade-secrets theft prosecution. Thomas Green, a lawyer for the Shenzhen, China-based telecommunications giant, said at conference in the case on Wednesday that travel restrictions have made it impossible for defense lawyers to gather evidence. The U.S. State Department last month issued a do-not-travel warning for China over the COVID-19 virus outbreak, and many airlines have also canceled flights.“Now we can’t visit our clients,"" Green, who represents Huawei and three related entities, told U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in federal court in Brooklyn. “This is going to inevitably impact the progress of our efforts on this.""He told the judge the defense was already hampered by national-security restrictions on what he and other American defense lawyers could share with their overseas clients.Donnelly was sympathetic to Green’s virus woes but said, “Clearly there is not a lot we can do about that."" She set the next conference in the case for April 21.The case is not the only one affected by the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December. In January, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker Roger Ng won a delay of his foreign bribery trial in federal court in Brooklyn from May until September because his lawyer was unable to travel to Asia to gather evidence.Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is fighting extradition from Canada, were first charged in 2018 with conspiring to circumvent U.S. trade sanctions on Iran and North Korea.

61,Karachi-bound Chinese ship found carrying parts used to make nuclear missile,"NEW DELHI: A Hong Kong flagged ship bound for Karachi and intercepted by Indian customs officials early February has been found carrying equipment that can be used to manufacture parts of nuclear capable ballistic missiles. A person familiar with the development said the ship, Da Cui Yun, was carrying an autoclave which can be used in the launch of ballistic missiles. The ship started its journey from China’s Jiangsu province and was bound for Karachi's Port Qasim.An autoclave is a pressure chamber to carry out various industrial and scientific processes. It has been certified as a “dual-use"" item, which means it can be used for civilian and military purposes. Among its uses is the manufacture of the motor of long range missiles, with range of 1,500 kilometres or more. It can also be used in the construction of a motor for the launch of satellites, say analysts. Pakistan has the Shaheen II missile in its arsenal which has a range of the 1,500-2,000 kilometres.The story of the ship's interception was first reported by the Hindustan Times.According to the person cited above, the ship, intercepted on 3 February, underwent detailed inspection at Kandla Port in Gujarat. Scientists of India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were called in to check the autoclave that had been described as an industrial dryer by the crew.Pakistan, China and North Korea have had a history of nuclear proliferation that has been recognised and documented in the past. It was North Korea and then China that is reported to have helped Pakistan develop a nuclear missile delivery platform by clandestinely transferring the M-11 and M-9 series of missiles in the 1980s and early 1990s.The 28,341-tonne dead weight vessel measures 166.5x27.4 metres and was built in 2011 in the home port of Hong Kong. Port Qasim is in Karachi, Sindh, where the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), responsible for Pakistan ballistic missile programme, is based, the Hindustan Times report said."

63,"Short on funds, Karnataka increases taxes on liquor by 6%","BENGALURU :The Karnataka government on Thursday increased the excise duty on liquor by 6% to mitigate the fund crunch the state is currently facing due to pending payments and slashing of the state’s share under the 15th Finance Commission calculations. ""I propose to increase the existing rates of additional excise duty by 6% across all 18 slabs ...."" BS Yediyurappa said while presenting the state budget.As one of the biggest revenue sources for the state, the hike is likely to impact overall growth of the sector, opposition leaders say.""With this (hike) and with effective enforcement and regulatory measures, the department would be achieving the target of  ₹22700 crore fixed for financial year 2020-21,"" Yediyurappa said. The target was set at  ₹20950 crore in the previous fiscal and the department has so far collected  ₹19701 crore, the government announced.""It’s not a secure financial approach because at some point the per capita consumption of liquor is going to start dropping,"" Krishna Byre Gowd, former minister and Congress legislator said. He added that this was not a sustainable approach and would have collateral costs on society and government,"" he said.Tax on petrol was increased from 32% to 35% and diesel from 21% to 24%. This would translate to an increase of  ₹1.60 per liter of petrol and  ₹1.59 on diesel. He also announced an increase in Excise duty on IML by 6% across 18 slabs to help improve the contribution of the sector that has been a consistent source of revenue for the state.Gowda said it was unfair to continuously tax citizens as this would affect everyone."
64,Analysis: Why the fed is likely to cut again,"The three main reasons behind the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts on Tuesday help explain why the central bank is likely to lower rates again. The Fed hoped to boost public confidence, prevent financial conditions from worsening and cushion the U.S. economy against a global growth downturn.While the rate cut may help on each of those fronts, the outlook could grow darker in the weeks ahead as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases rises.The rate cut Tuesday came between the Fed’s regularly scheduled policy meetings, illustrating urgency to get ahead of an unfolding shock, even if the underlying nature of the threat isn’t economic.Since 1998, the Fed has cut interest rates six other times between regularly scheduled meetings. Following each of those moves, the Fed has lowered rates again at its next policy meeting.“For us, what really matters of course is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy,"" said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday. “So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act.""Any good economic data released in coming weeks can be easily dismissed because they will show how the economy fared prior to the spread of the virus. And more bad news seems likely.Confidence could falter as health authorities test more widely for the infection, revealing how far it has spread and possibly prompting school closures and remote work arrangements.“The effects are at a very early stage,"" said Mr. Powell, referring to increasingly negative sentiment from travel and hospitality businesses. “We expect that will continue. It will probably grow.""The same dynamic could weigh on financial markets. Measures to contain and mitigate the damage could force companies to lower their earnings forecasts and weigh on stock and corporate-bond markets. The Fed acted Tuesday rather than wait until its March 17-18 meeting to prevent a deeper pullback in credit availability that can occur when lenders reassess borrowers’ creditworthiness.Mr. Powell said the Fed was prepared for a possible increase in corporate defaults or business failures. “We don’t see any of that happening yet. Of course, we are thinking about what we can do, should those things happen,"" he said.Finally, the U.S. economy faces disrupted supply chains and weaker global economic activity. This downturn could deepen if policy makers abroad aren’t able or willing to spur growth. Interest rates are already low and many central banks don’t have the wherewithal to reduce them much further.Countries already experiencing low rates of growth—such as Italy, Japan and Germany—are very likely to sink into recession in the coming months. “We need to be mindful that the impact from the outbreak could be big,"" Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Wednesday.Other central banks with interest rates above zero cut them this week. The Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate by half a percentage point, and the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to a record low of 0.5%.The Fed’s cut took its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%, leaving it more room than most other developed-economy central banks to cut further. U.S. rate cuts also make it easier for central banks in emerging markets to lower their borrowing costs without triggering capital flight.U.S. bond markets may be showing greater signs of hazard ahead. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to new lows on Tuesday and Wednesday. While declines in bond yields in recent weeks have reflected lower inflation expectations and investors seeking havens, most of the most recent drop reflects lower growth expectations, said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro.Over more than 6,000 trading days since 1997, growth expectations reflected in the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen by a larger magnitude than they did on Tuesday only 25 times, and most of those were during or before recessions hit, he said.Lower borrowing costs aren’t likely to be effective without broader confidence-building efforts by federal and local authorities to demonstrate they have put in place measures to diagnose and slow the spread of the new coronavirus.Stock markets tumbled after Tuesday’s Fed decision but rallied on Wednesday, illustrating how investors are still reconciling the challenges facing corporate profits and economic activity in the months ahead.Tuesday’s rate cut shouldn’t be judged by immediate market reactions, said Jim Vogel, a rate strategist at FHN Financial in Memphis, Tenn.“It was not a ‘rescue’ mission that demands an immediate letter grade from bond or stock traders who are still dealing with intensely volatile prices,"" he said. “It was a first step, designed to keep the central bank in line with [the disease’s] spread over the last two weeks.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."

You’ve got lots of video-calling apps to choose from—Skype, Google Hangouts, Zoom or even FaceTime. Choose whatever your colleagues use and feel comfortable with.I’m not going to provide tips on how to best video-chat. Just remember: The camera is on, and your colleagues don’t want to see your zebra-patterned pajamas. Oh, and light sources should be in front of you, not behind you—no backs to the window.Fun fact from Mr. Higgins: Video-conferencing services are likely to be bigger bandwidth hogs than Netflix. Streaming apps download streams in chunks of data, while video chat has to be constantly streaming.Crap, there’s an important document on my work desktop.Companies now offer cloud drive storage that’s secure and easy to use. You can tuck files you might need in there for safekeeping and remote access. If your company doesn’t have the option, you could use the storage available free from Google, Apple, Microsoft or Dropbox, or pay for an upgraded plan. Even though cloud drives are private, it’s on you to make sure you’re not copying over anything that could be deemed especially sensitive by your company.There are also ways to access your desktop computer remotely, but this falls into the domain of your IT department, and I don’t recommend you do it without your employer’s permission and assistance.Martin in Sales: Your daughter is cute and all, but we don’t want to hear “Let It Go"" for the 100th time.Mute your mic, aka MYM. Write it down on a Post-it, your hand, I don’t care. If you’re on a call, just mute whenever you aren’t talking. And please share this tip with Martin in Sales!I use my desk phone to make overseas calls, and there’s no way I’m using my smartphone and paying overage bills.Google Hangouts, WhatsApp and Skype allow you to make phone calls over the Internet to anywhere in the world for very low rates. And if you’re both on the service, the call is free.Speaking of calls, you’ll likely be on a lot of them. Keep a portable charger handy. Again, I like Anker—particularly this model.I decided to quickly clip my toenails in the bathroom, and now my boss is freaking out that I’m not responding.Communication is the toughest part of telecommuting. Managers, the best thing you can do is set expectations ahead of time. One good, but by no means foolproof, solution? If you’re using Slack or Google Hangouts, set a status message that tells your colleagues you’ve stepped away and when you’ll be back. In Slack, click the down arrow by your name (upper left corner) and select “Edit Status.""In the interest of transparency: I wrote this column not at home but at The Wall Street Journal headquarters—where my toenails might or might not have also been clipped. Don’t forget to send me your WFH gripes or helpful tips.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."
67,"Volkswagen launches BS6 compliant Polo and Vento: Prices, variants explained","Volkswagen India has upgraded its popular Polo and Vento line-up with BS6 engines. The new versions have been revealed almost a month before the prescribed BS6 deadline of April 1. Volkswagen has also revealed the pricing of the new versions of both cars. Due to the stricter emission standards, the company had to ditch the diesel engines. The Polo managed to maintain the same pricing when compared to the outgoing BS4 variants. The starting price is  ₹5.82 lakh and it goes all the way to  ₹9.59 lakh (ex-showroom). The car will be available with two petrol engines. The first is a naturally aspirated, 1.0-litre MPI engine which is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. The other engine is a turbocharged 1.0-litre TSI which is only available in the top two trims, Highline Plus and GT Line. Both these variants are available with a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed torque converter automatic.Surprisingly, the top GT variant is cheaper by  ₹17,000 when compared to the outgoing BS4 variant of the car. The turbo petrol engine puts out 110PS of power and 173Nm of torque.The Vento line-up starts at  ₹8.86 lakh (ex-showroom) for the base variant and goes all the way up to  ₹13.29 lakh. The car will be powered by a 1.0-litre TSI petrol engine. However, the 6-speed automatic transmission is only available with the top two variants, Highline and Highline Plus.The discontinuation of diesel engines is bound to impact the manufacturer’s standing in the market. Volkswagen, similar to Maruti, won’t be launching smaller diesel engines. Hyundai, on the other hand, plans to fill this void by launching a wide range of BS6 compliant diesel cars."
68,Your EPF money to fetch lowest interest rate in over five years,"The Central Board of Trustees of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has recommended interest rate of 8.5% - the lowest interest rate in over five years - on provident fund deposits to around six crore subscribers for the current financial year (2019-20), Press Trust of India reported, citing Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar. This is lower than the 8.65% interest rate given on employees' provident fund (EPF) deposits for the previous financial year 2018-19. The EPFO had provided 8.65% rate of interest to its subscribers for 2016-17 and 8.55% in 2017-18. The rate of interest was slightly higher at 8.8% in 2015-16.The retirement fund body had provided 8.75% rate of interest in 2013-14 as well as 2014-15, higher than 8.5% for 2012-13.The finance ministry, according to reports, has been nudging the labour ministry for aligning the EPF interest rate with other small saving schemes run by the government like the public provident fund and post office saving schemes.The labour ministry requires the finance ministry's concurrence to provide a rate of interest on EPF deposits in a fiscal year. Since the Government of India is the guarantor, finance ministry vets the proposal for EPF interest rate to avoid any liability on account of shortfall in the EPFO income for a fiscal.The labour ministry had earlier implemented retirement fund body EPFO's decision to restore pension commutation under the Employees' Pension Scheme, a move that will benefit 6.3 lakh pensioners.Pension commutation refers to part-withdrawal of fund in advance by a subscriber, who then gets reduced pension amount for 15 years.On February 20, the ministry notified the decision of the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to restore pension of those who opted for commutation of their pension on or before September 25, 2008.As many as 6.3 lakh pensioners would benefit from the decision. They had opted for commutation of their pension and got a lump sum at the time of retirement from their pension fund on or before September 25, 2008. (With Agency Inputs)"

82,Bank strike this month to protest against mergers of PSU banks,"NEW DELHI :Days after bank unions called off a three-day bank strike from March 11, two unions called for another bank strike on March 27 to oppose the mega merger of PSU banks. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced yesterday that the Union Cabinet has approved the plan to merge 10 PSU banks into four larger banks. The merger comes into effect from April 1 this year. The All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) and All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA) have given a joint call for an all-India bank strike on March 27. Their demands include stopping the proposed merger of 10 PSU banks, stopping the privatisation of IDBI Bank and rollback of banking reforms, recovery of bad loans and increase of interest rate on deposits.C.H. Venkatachalam, general secretary, AIBEA, said, the unions have planned series of protests this month peaking with the strike on March 27. The Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) has also announced a fortnight-long agitation programme to protest against the merger.""Banks themselves face problems due to huge pile of bad loans. While the public sector banks made a total gross profit of  ₹150,000 crore for the year ended March 31, 2019, because of total provisions towards bad loans, etc. amounting to  ₹216,000 crore, the banks ended in a net loss of  ₹66,000 crore,"" Venkatachalam said.Sitharaman, on the other hand, said the merger plan would enhance customer convenience, better branch service, higher credit flow, and lesser time in loan sanctions. Greater scale and synergy through consolidation would lead to cost benefits which should enable the PSBs enhance their competitiveness and positively impact the Indian banking system, a Finance Ministry statement said.As per the amalgamation plan, United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce would be merged with Punjab National Bank, making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank.It was decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, while Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India."
83,"For Blackstone, India is the 'strongest performer' in the world","India’s economic slowdown coupled with a credit crisis is creating a surge in demand for capital from beleaguered companies that are providing Blackstone Group Inc. with buyout opportunities in Asia’s third-largest economy. “We are not taking a cautious stance of watch and wait,"" Amit Dixit, Blackstone’s senior managing director, said in an interview in Mumbai on Wednesday. “We are actually taking a forward-leaning stance.""For Blackstone, India is the “strongest performer"" in the world, said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive officer of the world’s largest alternative asset manager. The company, which has invested $6 billion in India in the past 18 months, is scouting for opportunities as financiers and banks focus on recovering from a crisis that began with the collapse of an infrastructure financier in 2018, slowing down lending in the process.Central bank data show loan growth sunk to a more than two-year low in February, despite the Reserve Bank of India lowering borrowing costs five times last year. The world’s highest bad-loan ratio amid waning consumer demand in an economy that’s set for its weakest expansion in 11 years has stymied lending.“When growth slows down, your credit off take goes down,"" central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an interview on Tuesday. With sales dropping at corporates “it could impact their behavior in terms of repayment of loans.""In India Blackstone, which operates three businesses including private equity, real estate and tactical opportunities, has acquired a shadow bank, and manufacturers of auto parts and packaging material. The fund is also the largest owner of commercial real estate in India and was the first to sell units in a real estate investment trust last year.“Underlying theme of slowdown in the economy combined with the credit crisis has led to this acceleration,"" said Dixit.In January, Blackstone invested  ₹380 crore ($52 million) in a warehousing unit of Allcargo Logistics Ltd. with an option to increase the stake over the next 12 months based on achievement of pre-agreed performance milestones. Last month it proceeded with the acquisition of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd.’s technology park by paying the first tranche of  ₹150 crore out of the total  ₹2700 crore.Blackstone sees buyout opportunities increasing across the world as the coronavirus outbreak spooks financial markets and hurts company valuations, said CEO Schwarzman.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

84,"Genesis reveals 2021 G80 luxury sedan, impresses in first official images","Genesis has unveiled the all-new G80 to online audiences via a series of design renderings. The all-new G80 is the third-generation model which leads Genesis in the luxury market as a mid-sized, executive luxury sedan. ""The Genesis design DNA begins from the logo itself,"" said Luc Donckerwolke, Executive Vice President, Chief Design Officer of Hyundai Motor Group. ""The crest of the logo becomes the Crest Grille and the two lines of the wings become the Quadlamps. In other words, the design starts with the brand, and design is the brand.""The design of the new Genesis G80 is quite sleek. The company calls it the ‘Athletic Elegance’ design language that allows variations in design interpretations by enabling a carefully-considered balance between the two opposing characteristics. The all-new G80 is characterised by the Crest Grille, and the two lines of the Quadlamps circumventing all sides of the vehicle. These are signature design elements of the brand, first introduced in the GV80 and now in the all-new G80.“A relationship begins at first sight. The distinctive “two lines"" signature of the Quadlamps presents a clear and unique Genesis identity within seconds,"" said Sang Yup Lee, Senior Vice President, Head of Genesis Design. “No matter what body type, sedan or SUV, the Quadlamps and Athletic Elegance design language present a distinctive brand identity, and this will enable Genesis to offer a fresh alternative within the existing luxury space.""The G80 offers style and practicality with the classic sedan profile, a rear-wheel drive proportion and smooth coupe like roofline. The side features a long sweeping Parabolic Line from front to rear flowing gently downwards. This is counterbalanced with an upswept chrome line to maintain directional posture. The sharp athletic power lines of the front and rear fenders emphasize the powerful stance of the 20-inch wheels.The rear image is defined by the Quadlamps and the horseshoe shaped negative surface of the decklid. The trunk release button and surrounding chrome garnish mimics the shape of the Genesis logo.""Inside, the Beauty of White Space’ theme represents our journey to achieve the perfect balance between personal space and state-of-the-art technology."" said Sang Yup Lee. ""We question the status quo. Technology should not dominate and only present itself when necessary. This is the new luxury experience our Genesis customers expect in today’s high-end user experience.""At the front, the dashboard is deconstructed to an open space featuring a widescreen 14.5-inch infotainment screen. The slim air conditioning vent visually stretches the width of the cabin. Genesis engineers took special care to reduce the thickness of the A-pillars and the size of the rearview mirror, giving the driver a panoramic view.The all-new G80 will debut this month and features a new design, platform, powertrains and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)."

86,Govt may ask SBI to buy stake in Yes Bank: Report,"The government may ask State Bank of India (SBI) to lead a consortium that will buy stake in private lender Yes Bank Ltd, news agency Bloomberg said quoting people in the know. The public-sector bank has also been authorised to pick other members of the consortium. Yes Bank has been struggling to find investors to execute its plan to raise funds worth $2 billion despite several efforts. The bank has been in trouble since its founder and former chief execute officer (CEO) Rana Kapoor was not given an extension by the Reserve Bank of India in 2018 owing to corporate governance issues and under-reporting of bad loans. Kapoor’s term as the bank’s CEO had ended on January 2019.Shares of Yes Bank jumped nearly 12% to  ₹32, while that of SBI tumbled more than 3% to  ₹276.65 on the BSE.Mint was the first to report that the government and RBI were considering all options, including an interim bailout of Yes Bank, in case the proposed fundraising was to get more delayed.The government and RBI are of the view that Yes Bank's collapse can have a domino effect on interlinked financial institutions and impair growth for the banking sector.In January, even SBI's chairman Rajnish Kumar had said Yes Bank ""will not be allowed to fail"" and  that “some solutions will emerge"" to steady the private lender. This indicated that something was in the works.Yes Bank's share value has eroded more than 80% in the past one year due to concerns overt its asset quality and uncertainty around its efforts to raise capital for growth purpose. Amid its fundraising efforts, the bank had in February said it was in talks with four potential investors due to which it delayed reporting its earnings for the quarter ended December.The bank will report its financial results on 14 March.

87,Number of new patients declining every day: Wuhan doctor's only hope amid coronavirus outbreak,"One month after makeshift hospitals opened to chaos and confusion at the epicentre of China's coronavirus epidemic, frontline doctor Ma Yonggang is finally seeing more empty beds as fewer patients arrive. When 43-year-old Ma was first summoned to a sports stadium converted into a medical facility on February 4, it was a virtual construction site with electrical wiring and beds still being installed.Separated from his wife and young child who had returned to eastern Shandong province for Lunar New Year, Ma said he felt ""scared and anxious"" when the call from the jury-rigged Wuchang hospital came in the middle of the night.But the situation has slowly improved, with the number of patients receiving treatment in the improvised hospital declining from a high of 760 in mid-February to 320 earlier this week.""We had 30-40 patients being discharged per day, but the number of patients admitted was only a dozen or so. This was when the whole situation changed for us,"" Ma, who is the hospital's deputy director, told AFP in a video call from Wuhan.""Now, we admit very few new patients and about three to four recovered patients are discharged each day.""The situation Ma described tallies with officials' accounts of a slowdown in new infections in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have emerged at a market that sold wild animals.It was not always like this.AFP saw people standing in line for hours to see doctors in Wuhan's hospitals during the first weeks of the crisis, when the facilities lacked enough beds for the thousands of new patients.- Conditions 'were quite bad' -Hastily converted from sports stadiums, schools and cultural venues, Wuhan's 16 makeshift ""ark"" hospitals were designed to ease the burden on the city's overstretched healthcare system.But in the early stages of the outbreak, they also suffered from the same widespread shortages of medical protective supplies as the city's designated hospitals, Ma said.The hospitals offer basic treatment and diagnosis for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, as well as simple recreational facilities.""When the hospital was opened, the facilities were only for controlling the outbreak, so the living conditions for patients and medical staff ... were quite bad,"" he said in the interview arranged by the State Council's information office.""Now, the conditions have improved a lot, for example now we have patient exercise areas and bathrooms, and we have indoor heating and catering services.""Ma admitted that conditions fell short of patients' expectations and those hoping for small rooms to themselves were not prepared for the open-plan layout of the makeshift hospital.""Once they arrived, they realised that there were several patients in a large open room and began to doubt whether they could be treated successfully,"" he said.- Mourning fallen doctors -More than 80,000 people have been infected and more than 3,000 killed by the new coronavirus in mainland China, with the majority in Wuhan.Chinese health authorities and a team of World Health Organization experts say that at least 3,000 Chinese medical workers have caught the virus -- mostly in Wuhan -- and at least 11 have lost their lives.But according to Ma, none of the medical workers at the city's makeshift hospitals have been infected.The death last month of whistleblower Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old Wuhan ophthalmologist who was punished for trying to alert people to the outbreak in December, unleashed a torrent of grief and anger at the authorities.""We felt extremely sad at his death,"" Ma said.""We will always mourn (Li and the other fallen doctors), and we must learn from them and dedicate ourselves even more to fighting the virus.""One of the latest victims was Li's colleague, Mei Zhongming, who was deputy director of ophthalmology department at the central hospital and died from the virus on Tuesday.While Ma said he was nervous about the possibility of infection, he remained committed to his duties.""As Wuhan medical workers, this historic responsibility has fallen on our shoulders,"" he said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

His big bet lies on India’s consumers. “We are bullish on consumption,"" said Singhania. He oversees Motilal Oswal AMC’s Midcap 30 Fund, which has beaten 93% of peers in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Most companies in our portfolio are gaining market share at the expense of smaller and unorganized players that face liquidity challenges.""With India’s economic expansion at an almost seven-year low, Mumbai-based Singhania looks for consumer-linked companies whose earnings stand to increase even in a gloomy growth environment or that have high return on capital and low levels of debt. Those include lenders who help finance consumption as well as consumer-discretionary and staples shares, such as fast-food chain operator Jubilant Foodworks Ltd. and shoemaker Bata India Ltd.Consumer-related stocks accounted for about a third of the fund’s $270 million in assets as of the end of January.Motilal Oswal's fund keeps its focus despite virus scare AU Small Finance Bank Ltd., the fund’s biggest holding, has more than doubled in the past year. It moved quickly to fill the space left by non-bank finance companies hit by a credit squeeze, Singhania said. Astral Poly Technik Ltd., which makes plumbing systems, is another of his favorites. Sales volume could grow 25% in the coming quarter as it grabs market share from regional and unorganized rivals struggling to secure funds, its chief financial officer said in a call with analysts last month.Stocks have suffered recently as the coronavirus spread outside of China, raising concerns over its impact on the global economy and profit growth. The S&P BSE MidCap Index tumbled 7% last week, matching the drop in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index. The Motilal Oswal mid-cap fund fared a bit better, falling only 5%.Singhania sees the virus hit as a short-term hiccup that won’t affect earnings of the companies he owns. But if any of them fails to deliver strong profit growth, he’ll sell.“If growth in profit-after-tax goes haywire - below our target of 10%-12% - nine times out of 10 that’s why we would sell a stock,"" Singhania said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

89,Why women need their own money goals,"There are many battles that women fight every day. While many remain to be won, some are conquered with such aplomb that it inspires others to step up and follow suit. The numbers are still stacked against them, but it’s not uncommon to find women focussing on their careers and holding out on their own. But women who are on top of money management are still rare. Major life events like marriage or having a baby can impact a woman’s life much more than that of her male counterpart. So having a grip on personal finances needs to be the top priority for every woman. Women are already good at saving, so it should be a short journey to investing it well. It doesn’t matter if you are single or married, working or a homemaker—the transition from a saver to an investor needs to happen.With International Women’s Day around the corner, Mint’s personal finance team spoke to women who are at different junctures of their lives to bring together some tips on how to be financially prepared so that milestones are joyous, and setbacks less taxing.Also Read: Marriage does not mean losing financial independenceAlso Read: It’s important to prepare yourself before having childrenAlso Read: What to do in the face of a setbackAlso Read: ‘Hang in there and believe that it can be done, and you will find solutions’Also Read: Re-skilling can open up whole new avenues after a sabbaticalAlso Read: Women need to plan their finances to have a regular income in retirement"

93,Coronavirus update: Australia bans entry of nationals from some countries,"Australia today banned the arrival of foreigners from South Korea, tightening its border controls in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus as it recorded its second death from the illness. Prime Minister Scott Morrison also extended existing bans on foreigners arriving from mainland China and Iran and said there would be tougher screening processes for people arriving from Italy.""It affords the best protection and enables us to slow down the rate of transmission,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra, as health officials said a worst case scenario for the virus' spread was the infection of millions of people within weeks.Australia was one of the first countries to take a hardline approach to tackling the coronavirus outbreak, imposing border controls on visitors from the epidemic's epicentre in China just over a month ago.Australia has recorded 53 cases of the coronavirus, the majority of those people who contracted the disease overseas before returning home for treatment. However, concerns are growing about the likelihood of a more rapid spread given at least five people contracted the illness locally.Despite official attempts to quell public anxiety, the country's major grocers this week reported consumer stockpiling and social media was awash with photographs and videos of overloaded shopping trolleys.Several stores imposed strict limits on purchases of items, notably toilet paper, as a result.An elderly woman who became the country's second fatality this week picked up the virus from a worker at her aged care home, making her death the first from local transmission. Health authorities have confirmed another resident at the facility has tested positive, despite not coming into contact with the infected worker.The new travel restrictions mean that any foreign traveller who has been in China, Iran and South Korea - all countries that have reported large outbreaks of the coronavirus - within two weeks of arriving in Australia will be turned away. The bans will be reviewed on a weekly basis.Australian nationals and residents are exempt from the bans, but are required to self-isolate for two weeks on their return to Australia.Travellers from Italy will be given temperature checks and required to completed a detailed health questionnaire before they are cleared for entry.The Australian government earlier on Thursday warned that the crisis will subtract at least half a percentage point from the country's economic growth in the current quarter.Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy said it was too early to determine the long-term economic toll of the epidemic, but it was clear it would have immediate and significant effects.""At this stage we expect the virus to detract at last half a percentage point from growth in the March quarter 2020,"" Kennedy said, adding the forecast took into account the impact on tourism, international education and some exchange rate effects.The estimate is in line with that made by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Treasury had forecast gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.25% to end-June 2020.The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday cut interest rates to a record low 0.50%, hoping to give the A$2 trillion ($1.32 trillion) economy enough of a boost to continue a record 29 years of recession-free growth.Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said a stimulus package expected to be announced within days will be worth billions of dollars and targeted to sectors most affected by the coronavirus.""It is going to have a 'b' in front of it that is for sure,"" Frydenberg told Sky News.

95,"Bank of Baroda, HDFC cut home loan rates","The state-owned Bank of Baroda and HDFC Limited have lowered interest rates on their home loans marginally. Though these two lenders have reduced rates, other banks may not follow suit at least until April, according to experts. To bring down rates of new customers, Bank of Baroda has lowered the mark-up it charges on the external benchmark. For home loans, the bank was charging a spread of 300 basis points (bps) above the repo rate, which is 5.15% at present. The lowest interest on a home loan was, therefore 8.15%. It has brought down the spread by 15 bps, which is now at 285 bps. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Bank of Baroda was able to lower the mark-up on the repo rate as its cost of funds came down. “Based on the December data, we reviewed our cost of funds. As it was lower, we passed the benefit to the borrowers. We do this review every quarter,"" said Virendra Kumar Sethi, head, mortgages and other retail assets, Bank of Baroda.On 5 March, HDFC Limited revised its retail prime lending rate by 5 basis points (bps). The lender’s retail prime lending rate is at 16.6%, according to its website. In an intimation to stock exchanged, the housing finance company (HFC) said that the change will be effective 9 March 2020 and benefits all existing retail home loan customers. The lowest home loan rate for HDFC is now at 8%, according to its website.OTHER LENDERS MAY NOT FOLLOWHDFC is one of the biggest lenders in the home loan segment. Bank of Baroda has been aggressively growing its home loan book in recent years. Despite them cutting rates, other lenders may not follow, according to experts. “Most banks have priced their loans aggressively. State Bank of India (SBI), which is the biggest lender in the retail home segment, already has the lowest rate at 7.95%. Interest rates from many other public sector banks are close to it,"" said Gaurav Gupta, co-founder and CEO, MyLoanCare.in.The home loan rates for Bank of India, Canara Bank, Central Bank of India and Punjab National Bank are 8.0%, 8.05%, 8.0% and 7.95% respectively, according to banks’ websites. Among the housing finance companies, HDFC’s home loan rate is the most competitively priced among HFCs.Others agree with Gupta. “As the rates are already aggressive, we are seeing that lenders are giving discounts on processing fees to lure customers. At least until April, we don’t believe there would be any meaningful revision of rates by other lenders,"" said Aditya Mishra, founder and CEO, Switchme.in, a platform that helps borrowers shift their home loans to other financial institutions.STIFF COMPETITIONIn its sixth bi-monthly meeting for FY20 held on 6 February, Reserve Bank of India did not change rates. Instead, the banking regulator introduced long-term repo operations (LTRO) under which banks could receive cheaper long-term funds. It also announced the relaxation of cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirements for home and auto loans and loans to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME). These two combined moves are expected to lower the cost of funds for banks, which they are expected to pass on to new as well as old borrowers.Experts say that while this is one of the reasons for banks to lower rates, it’s also due to fierce competition. “Bank of Baroda is matching its lowest rate to that of SBI, which has the most competitive rate in the industry. But as Bank of Baroda is still not a significant player compared to SBI in the home loan segment. The latter, therefore, won’t face any pressure after the rate cut,"" said Gupta.Being an HFC, the case for HDFC is different as RBI’s monetary policy measures do not directly impact it. Besides the cost of funds and other aspects, stiff competition is also one of the factors for keeping the lending rate competitive.It’s the SBI, which sets the trend for the interest rates in the market. Unless the country’s largest bank revises rates downwards, there won’t be any meaningful lowering of interest rates by other lenders."

97,Coronavirus wipes $50 billion off global exports in February alone: Economists,"United Nations: UN economists announced a likely $50 billion drop in worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone as the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19 moved further into focus. Citing the China Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI), Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTAD’s Division on International Trade and Commodities, said that it had fallen to 37.5 - a drop of about 20 points – the lowest reading since 2004.“This also correlates directly to exports and also implies a two per cent drop in overall exports,"" she said, with a resulting “ripple effect"" worldwide “to the tune of a $50 billion fall in exports.""Because China has become the main supplier of finished products and so-called “intermediate"" products used in countless industries - from chemical for pharmaceuticals to parts for digital cameras and the car industry - concerns about the long-term disruption to supply chains there, has left many companies around the world “fearful"" that their own output may soon be affected, UNCTAD said.“Of course, if the virus continues to spread and gets out of control, and we see closures not only in China but also in India and the United States and everywhere else in the world, then it would be a big problem,"" said Alessandro Nicita from UNCTAD’s Division on International Trade and Commodities.“Ultimately, the economic impact of this virus depends on the measures that countries apply to contain the virus. So, China has done a great job in containing the virus, but it has sacrificed a little bit the economy, at least in the first few weeks. So, planned closures, restriction to movement of people, which were all necessary; but there is an economic effect when you take those measures.""In addition to the falling manufacturing levels, UNCTAD also highlighted a decrease in the number of container ships leaving Shanghai in the first half of February (from around 300 a week to 180), which then returned to normal levels in the second half of the month.“Right now, the impact on the global value chains is already being felt and will continue probably for a few months,"" Coke-Hamilton said.“But if it rebounds, say in the next few months, then the long-term or year-long impact will be a little different and will be better. So, it depends on what happens in China.""In remarks made at a joint press conference with the head of the World Bank Group, the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said that the UN-backed global funds would make up the shortfall, in effect, by offering to inject around $50 billion into low-income and emerging market nations, pending requests for support.""Thanks to the generosity of our shareholders, we have about $1 trillion in overall lending capacity,"" she said.""For low-income countries, we have rapid-disbursing emergency financing of up to $10 billion (50 per cent of quota of eligible members) that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme,"" she added.The IMF chief added that members can access emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument.""This facility could provide about $40 billion for emerging markets that could potentially approach us for financial support. We also have the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust – the CCRT – which provides eligible countries with up-front grants for relief on IMF debt service falling due.""The CCRT proved to be effective during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, but is now underfunded with just over $200 million available against possible needs of over $1 billion.""She called on member countries ""to help ensure that this facility is fully re-charged and ready for the current crisis"", and said that the Fund was ""fully committed to supporting our member countries, particularly the most vulnerable. We have the tools to help and we are coordinating closely with our partner institutions."" This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

98,Urban India feels financially unprotected says report,"Max life Insurance in partnership with KANTAR, a research company, has released the Indian Protection Quotient (IPQ) survey which shows how prepared urban Indians are to face financial uncertainties. As per the report, Urban India scores 37 on the scale of 0 to 100 and feels that they are underprepared to face the financial uncertainties. IPQ is a composite index which is prepared on the basis of various factors such as attitudes, mental preparedness around future uncertainties, awareness and ownership of life insurance product categories of the people surveyed.The IPQ score has seen an improvement of 2 points from last year. This year was the second addition of the survey.Speaking about the improvement on the IPQ Prashant Tripathy, Managing Director & CEO, Max Life Insurance said, “The survey witnessed a gradual but notable increase in IPQ over the last 12 months. With a movement of 2 points on the Protection Quotient scale from 35 to 37, it indicated that Indians are feeling slightly more protected.We have witnessed substantial increase in both awareness and ownership of life insurance and could be the reason for improvement in IPQ.""The survey also revealed that the awareness and ownership of term plans has improved over the last 12 months.As per the survey, the knowledge index that measures the level of awareness about the life insurance products has increased by 9 points to 48. Across the other insurance products including endowment plan and unit linked insurance plans (ULIPs), term plans saw highest rise in awareness by 1000 basis points (100 basis points is equal to one per cent) to 57% over the past 12 months as per the report. The ownership of term plans increased by 700 basis points to 28%.Talking about how the IPQ can be improved further Tripathy said, “Awareness and ownership are two key drivers of protection quotient and would always precede the increase in IPQ, which is composite index. There has been a significant improvement of 9 points in awareness index and 500 bps increase in life insurance ownership which is very encouraging. At the same time there has been an increase in anxiety about the financial future and I view it as a positive development because anxiety will drive people to action which in turn will result in better financial planning and protection.""The survey further revealed that although term plans saw highest increase in awareness, endowment plans continue to lead with an ownership at 30%.The report further revealed that the millennials have grown more anxious about financial security with their top anxieties being, day to day medical expenses and sustaining lifestyle and expenses with the current earnings. “When compared, women remained more anxious about financial security than men across several parameters. The survey also revealed that Tier II cities focus more on savings than protection and demonstrated a preference of endowment policies over term insurance,"" said the report.The survey is based on the responses of 7,014 people across 25 cities comprising of 6 metros, 9 Tier 1 and 10 Tier 2 cities."
99,Gold prices today fall for the first time in 3 days,"Gold prices in India today fell for the first time in three days as profit-taking and stronger equities hurt the precious metal. However, a weaker rupee capped the fall. Gold futures on MCX fell 0.55% today to  ₹43,330 per 10 gram on profit-taking after the recent rally that took prices closer to record highs. Tracking gold, silver prices also fell 0.6% to  ₹46,402. Gold can see some profit booking at higher levels, says SMC Global, adding that the precious metal can dip towards  ₹43,000 while facing resistance near  ₹43,800 on the higher side. Silver can dip towards  ₹46200 while taking resistance near  ₹46700, the brokerage added.  Gold prices were mostly flat today in global markets today as stronger equities and upbeat US data slightly dented the safe haven appeal of non-yielding assets like bullion. Spot gold was up 0.1% at $1,637.80 per ounce. US services sector activity jumped to a one-year high in February, recent data showed.Among other precious metals, silver rose 0.3% to $17.22 per ounce while platinum was steady at $872.40.The rupee in the previous session breached the 73.5 per dollar mark and some analysts say that it could weaken further. On the other hand, some analysts say that Reserve Bank of India may deploy some of its dollar stockpile to steady the rupee, which has tumbled more than 2% over the past week as more cases of coronavirus were reported in the country.India imports most of its gold requirement and besides the rupee-dollar value, import duty (12.5%) and GST (3%) determines the final price of bullion in the country.Global risk appetite has improved following stimulus announced by some central banks and going forward there is growing expectation of rate cut by some other central bank to limit the economic fallout of virus outbreak, Kotak Securities said.Development relating to virus outbreak may continue to be key price determining factor for commodities, including gold, as it will affect US dollar as well as general risk sentiment, Kotak Securities said in a note. Also in focus will be market reaction to recent easing by central banks along with hopes of further stimulus by other central banks to support growth, the brokerage added.According to the latest data, global coronavirus cases reached 94,410 while death toll rose past 3,200. The global spread of the virus has crushed hopes for stronger growth this year and has pushed investors into safe-haven assets like gold.The latest tranche of sovereign gold bonds will close for subscription on March 6th. The government is issuing these bonds at  ₹4,260 per gram of gold while those investing and making payment online get a discount of  ₹50 per gram.(With Agency Inputs)"
100,"EPF interest rate declaration likely today, five things to watch out for","NEW DELHI :Retirement fund manager, Employees Provident Fund Organization, will likely announce the interest rate on PF deposits of over 60 million active subscribers today. Here are the five things you need to know:EPFO Central Board meeting: The central board of trustees of the EPFO comprising representatives of employees, employers and governments both at the centre and some member states will meet on Thursday to take a call on several issues including the much-awaited interest rate for 2019-20 financial year, changes in investment pattern and way forward on its investments in troubled firms like IF&FS and DHFL.Interest Rate: There has been a constant demand from workers that the EPF interest payout should be higher, more so because of its investments in the stock market via exchange traded fund. But the retirement fund manager is yet to come to a decision on how it wants to pass on stock market investment gains to subscribers. All said, it will be tough for the EPFO this year to offer more than the 8.65% rate it offered in 2018-19. There is a good possibility that 2019-20 returns may be lower than last fiscal’s by 15-25 basis points.In 2018-19 the EPF paid a rate of 8.65%, 10 basis point more than 2017-18. In 2016-17 it was at 8.55%, the same as 2017-18, while in 2015-16 it had offered 8.8% as rate of interest to its subscribers.What may hold back EPFO to pay more?The retirement body invests 15% in equity market and 85% in debt instruments. The falling rate cycle in the debt investments would have hampered its income in 2019-20. For example, some long term fixed deposits and bond yields fell 50-90 basis points in 2019, as per EPFO estimates. Besides, last year, after an 8.65% payout ahead of the general elections, EPFO was left with a surplus of little over  ₹150 crore, much below the levels maintained earlier. In 2017-18, the surplus was at  ₹586 crore.What about increasing the minimum statutory pension for EPF subscribers?Though the demand for increasing minimum pension has been on the table for years, the EPFO has hesitated to raise it. An internal committee of the labour ministry has favoured doubling the minimum pension amount to  ₹2000 from  ₹1000 now, but neither the EPFO nor its controlling labour ministry can take a call on hiking the pension without a go-ahead from the finance ministry. A minimum statutory pension hike will cost the central government an extra Rs2500 crore-Rs4000 crore per year.Investment pattern: The EPFO central board is likely to approve a plan to allow the fund manager to formally invest in debt ETFs. When EPFO started investing in the stock market through ETFs, there were no provisions for debt ETFs but now the situation has changed, with the finance ministry also in favor of the move."

110,India firms up battle plan to counter Coronavirus outbreak,"NEW DELHI :With countries around the globe struggling to contain the Coronavirus outbreak, India’ playbook involves a ‘mitigation plan’,given the threat of contagion turning into a pandemic. The plan will be shared with all states and union territories. To help limit the contagion spread across the world’ second most populous country, the government may also close the Kartarpur and Wagah borders. The Bureau of Immigration is expected to provide Indian addresses and phone numbers of passengers.Given that Iran has emerged as a hotspot of these infections, the Indian government is also putting in place a Persian Gulf nation specific plan. The game plan is to follow the standard operating procedures adopted post the Influenza 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic.The strategy also involves roping in Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), defense, railways and paramilitary personnel, and readying quarantine facilities for around 4396 people across Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Army, Air force and Navy camps.The number of Covid-19 cases in India shot up to 29 after a clutch of Italian tourists in Jaipur tested positive, while health authorities on Wednesday reported a burgeoning trail after contact-tracing two previous patients.With the rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus and India’s compromised healthcare infrastructure, New Delhi is preparing itself to face the “once-in-a-century pathogen"" as termed by Bill Gates.

The strategy for the second phase involves holding a state level workshop in the in the second week of March followed by district level and hospital level training.“Currently, India has ample medicines and PPE stocks. Yet, we have already doubled up our demand for masks and sanitizers considering the evolving situation in India. Currently government is taking all possible steps to contain the infection and tracing all contacts of the positive cases. In case the situation worsens, we will need to further expand the health infrastructure to handle it,"" said Randeep Guleria, Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)Now being compared to the WHO’s “disease X,"" the contagion has raised serious doubts about an already slowing global growth and disintegration of supply chains. At least 78 countries have been affected by Covid-19. The Indian government has cautioned that people should avoid non-essential travel to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan and other affected countries.India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday said that the government may try to evacuate Indians stranded in Iran’s capital Teheran, where 2,336 people have been infected and 77 have died from the disease. There are at least 300 Indians in the Iranian capital, mostly students and pilgrims.An Indian Council of Medical Research representative has reached Iran along with reagents used necessary for the chemical analysis of the virus. This involves testing and quarantine of passengers from Iran before they depart for India.India was among Iran’s top oil customers until President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a historic 2015 accord with energy-rich nation, which was inked to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme in return for ending sanctions.While WHO’s Iran office has been roped in by the Indian embassy there for better coordination, the government will shortly take a decision for the locations of quarantine for evacuees from Iran.Presently, the ITBP has set up a 600-bed facility in Delhi's Chhawla area to quarantine coronavirus patient, while the Army has also set up a similar unit in Manesar near Gurugram.The quarantine facilities for 4396 people is being prepared at Central Armed Police Forces’ camps of BSF’ subsidiary training centres at Jodhpur, Bengaluru, Siliguri. In addition, the plans are to accommodate these people at CRPF’ centres at Pinjore, Guwahati, Kolkata, Odisha, Jammu and Delhi. The other locations include the NSG camp at Hyderabad, and Army, Airforce and Navy facilities across New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Jaiselmar.Given India’s porous borders with Nepal, eight central teams have visited districts adjoining Nepal border and reviewed border crossings and adjoining villages. Also, around 3360 Gram Sabha meetings have been conducted in 21 bordering districts in five states.In addition to network of 15 labs, 35 more labs are being brought online for testing the suspected patients. Besides reagents to test up to 25000 samples that is available, additional reagents for testing 30000--50000 samples are also being procured.Also to prevent any shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits necessary for healthcare workers, an additional procurement is being done for 1.5 lakh PPE kits and 3 lakh N-95 masks. Domestic manufacturers have also been identified for churning out coveralls with a combined capacity of 30,000 coveralls per week. There is a central inventory available of 50,000 of PPE kits and 2 lakh N-95masks.This comes in the backdrop of a WHO warning about severe and mounting disruption to the global supply of PPE caused by rising demand, panic buying, hoarding and misuse is putting lives at risk from the new coronavirus and other infectious diseases. WHO has given a call for increasing manufacturing by 40%.“Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, prices have surged. Surgical masks have seen a sixfold increase, N95 respirators have trebled and gowns have doubled,"" WHO said in a statement and added, “Supplies can take months to deliver and market manipulation is widespread, with stocks frequently sold to the highest bidder."""

115,Carnival’s Princess reroutes ship linked to coronavirus death,"Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises diverted a ship bound for Ensenada, Mexico, after a passenger who had recently traveled on the vessel died of coronavirus, becoming California’s first such fatality. The ship was being held off the coast of California to give state officials time to test passengers and crew for the virus, Governor Gavin Newsom said at a press conference. The Grand Princess had been scheduled to dock in San Francisco Wednesday night.“The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,"" Newsom said, shortly after announcing a emergency proclamation for the state.The 71-year-old male guest who died had sailed on the ship’s Feb. 11-21 voyage from San Francisco to Mexico. He tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, and Placer County health officials reported his death Wednesday. Newsom said another passenger from the same trip, a Sonoma County resident, had also tested positive for the virus and was in “very difficult condition.""The state, working with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is trying to track down every passenger from that first trip, Newsom said. According to the company, 62 people from that voyage are on the current excursion. Those guests must remain in their staterooms until they are screened by medical staff, the company said.Newsom said the state was flying test kits out to the ship and would likely process them at a lab in the San Francisco Bay Area. He said 21 passengers and crew were showing possible symptoms of the virus. Once testing is complete, state officials will have to decide where to let the Grand Princess dock, and under what precautions, Newsom said.Carnival’s Princess brand was at the center of the largest -- and to date only -- known outbreak of coronavirus at sea. More than 700 people who had been on board the Diamond Princess tested positive for the coronavirus and were under quarantine on board at one point in Yokohama, Japan.Since then, a number of cruise ships have been turned away from ports over fears that they could bring coronavirus ashore, even though passengers had not been found to have the virus.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

121,China's coronavirus slowdown offers hope for global containment,"The slowdown in coronavirus cases out of China offers a sliver of hope that the global outbreak can be controlled, but whether that can happen anytime soon without drastic measures remains to be seen, public health authorities say. With China accounting for the overwhelming majority of the world's 94,000 infections and 3,200 deaths since the virus first surfaced there in late December, it’s hard to see the country as a success story. But some experts believe the easing of the crisis — there are now more new cases being reported outside China than inside it — suggests containment is possible.World Health Organization outbreak expert Maria Van Kerkhove, who recently traveled to China as part of a team from the U.N. health agency, said the international experts noted a drop in cases there since the end of January.“We scrutinized this data and we believe this decline is real,"" she said, adding that the extraordinary measures undertaken in China — including the unprecedented lockdown of more than 60 million people — had a significant role in changing the direction of the outbreak.“We believe that a reduction of cases in other countries, including Italy, Korea, Iran, everywhere, that this is possible,"" she said.But the path to containment outside China is sure to be rocky, and no one is predicting when the outbreak might end.There is some consensus among public health experts: The virus is likely to be around for quite some time, perhaps many months, and will continue to spread to many places, but it can probably be controlled with standard public health measures, though not as quickly as in China.There is another consensus: China's outbreak has given other countries the advantage of knowing what they’re up against. The virus was an unknown entity when it appeared in China, and authorities there discounted the possibility of human-to-human transmission.The Chinese experience has bought other countries time to prepare and knowledge to better understand the nature of the virus.But Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said there is a more ominous message from the Chinese outbreak: “Authoritarian, free-speech restricting, individual rights-violating policies can panic populations, make conditions in an outbreak zone worse, and still fail to contain worldwide spread of a virus of this nature.""Emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University, said widespread quarantines, lockdowns and travel bans of the sort ordered by China’s regime are unlikely to be used in other countries. How those less-aggressive approaches will play out is unclear, she said.As China's numbers have stabilized, ""we are seeing this rapid escalation around the world. At this point I believe things will get much worse before they get better,"" Wen said Tuesday, ""and we have no idea what the trajectory will look like now that there is person-to-person transmission around the world.""While the crisis appears to be easing in China, alarming clusters have turned up in Italy, Iran South Korea and Japan. The U.S. has more than 120 cases in at least 15 states, with 11 deaths, all but one of them in Washington state.Dr. Albert Ko, a professor and department chairman at the Yale School of Public Health, said there were signs that the spread in China might have started slowing down even before authorities there implemented a travel ban and closed off Wuhan, the epicenter, in late January. That’s an argument for more conventional public health measures, including widespread testing, limiting of social gatherings and the closing of some schools.“Travel bans and lockdowns of cities, those are drastic measures that have really large costs with respect to social disruption, stigmatization and so forth,"" Ko said.Encouraging the public to take action may be more effective, he said.“The lowest-hanging fruit for us is really beefing up what people can do, why it’s important to stay home when you’re sick, why it’s important to do hand-washing"" and other preventive hygiene, Ko said.Dale Fisher of the University of Singapore said the four large outbreaks outside China suggest what the next few weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic might look like.“I think the virus is behaving very much as we would expect it to,"" he said. “There are now four parts of the world with heavy transmission rates, and there will probably be one or two more next week. One or two of these might come under control, but there will likely be activity elsewhere.""Mistakes and slowness in the U.S. effort to start large-scale testing for the virus have limited officials’ ability for the moment to get a handle on the scope of its spread, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, a specialist in infectious diseases and chairman of the global health department at Emory University in Atlanta.Many state labs have yet to develop their own tests because of early federal restrictions, since removed. It is still taking four to five days to get results back from tests that must be sent on to more distant labs, Del Rio said. And federal guidelines, though revised recently, continue to limit who gets tested, he said.Federal health officials ""dropped the ball, period,"" he said.The high number of deaths in Washington state relative to the few dozen infected suggests that many people with the disease are being missed, he said. Aggressive testing is likely to reveal many more cases, Del Rio said.“I don’t think we’re going to limit community transmission, but my hope is that we’re not going to have community transmission everywhere,"" he said.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday it is providing $35 million to 28 states and localities to help their public health departments respond to the outbreak and increase their surveillance for the virus. Some of the funding is earmarked for such things as monitoring of travelers, lab equipment and surge staffing.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Trade wars pushed global growth last year to the lowest rate since a 0.7% contraction in 2009.The changed forecast would represent a more than 0.4-percentage-point drop from the 3.3% growth the IMF had estimated for 2020 in January as U.S.-China trade tensions eased.""Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year's levels, but how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict,"" Georgieva said.She declined to say whether the escalating health crisis could push the world into a recession.The IMF is making available $50 billion in emergency funding to help poor and middle-income countries with weak health systems respond to the epidemic, she said after a call with the IMF's steering committee.About $10 billion of that can be accessed by the poorest countries at zero interest for up to 10 years, while many middle-income countries have access to a pool of about $40 billion at low interest for up to five years.Ecuador used the latter program in 2016 to get a $364 million loan after a devastating earthquake.But larger emerging-market countries such as Brazil, China, and India are ineligible for such assistance, as are countries where the IMF has declared debt to be unsustainable, including Argentina.Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass underscored the importance of coordinated action to limit the economic and human impact of the virus.The World Bank said on Tuesday it was providing $12 billion in immediate funds to help developing countries improve their health services, disease surveillance, access to medical supplies and working capital for businesses.DEEPER DECLINELess than two weeks ago, the IMF told G20 finance leaders in Saudi Arabia that the virus could shave 0.1 percentage point off its January global growth forecast, a milder scenario based on expectations the coronavirus would be largely contained within China.That view changed over the past week as the virus spread rapidly outside China to more than 70 countries, Georgieva said.The shift has vastly increased uncertainty and caused demand worldwide to weaken, hitting trade and tourism hard and slashing demand for oil and other commodities as individuals and businesses take precautionary measures to avoid infection.In China, even as the spread of the virus has slowed, growth will be below the IMF's most recent forecast for 5.6% in 2020, Georgieva said.Still, the Fund was encouraged by the restart of some production in China, which is now at about 60% recovered and aiming to reach 90% in coming weeks, she said.She declined to discuss more specific scenarios on potential downgrades in growth estimates, saying: ""What helps is concentrating on actions. Who cares if it will be 0.1 or 0.4 or 0.5? If we act, and focus on that, lives would be saved, suffering would be reduced and the economy would perk up faster.""

125,In Italy and beyond. How coronavirus outbreak reshapes work and play,"Rome: Italy closed all schools and universities Wednesday and barred fans from all sporting events for the next few weeks, as governments trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus around the world resorted to increasingly sweeping measures that transformed the way people work, shop, pray and amuse themselves. With the virus now reported in more than 80 countries, Saudi Arabia barred citizens from making the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Iran canceled Friday prayers for a second week, and leader after leader pleaded with citizens to put an end to that traditional symbol of mutual trust, the handshake.The Italian government decreed that soccer games and other sporting events will take place without fans present until at least April 3. Italy is is the epicenter of Europe's coronavirus outbreak. More than 3,000 have been infected and at least 107 have died, the most of any country outside China.Italy also closed schools for 8.4 million students through March 15, after at least four other countries — Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Iraq — took similar action.“I know it’s a decision with an impact. As education minister, I obviously want my students back in school as soon as possible,"" said Education Minister Lucia Azzolina.With the disease ebbing in the place where it began, Italy, Iran and South Korea confronted deadly, fast-growing clusters of the disease that accounted for about 80% of new cases outside China, according to the World Health Organization. In all, more than 94,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide, with more than 3,200 deaths.In the United States, the death toll reached 11.Iran reported 92 deaths among its more than 2,900 cases, though many fear the outbreak is far bigger. Among the ill are dozens of members of the government. The Islamic republic canceled Friday prayers to avoid public gatherings.“The virus has no wings to fly,"" said Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. “We are the ones who transfer it to each other.""WHO said about 3.4% of people infected with the COVID-19 virus globally have died, making it more lethal than the common flu. But that figure was met with skepticism, with scientists noting that large numbers of mild cases have probably gone undetected or unreported. A study last week in the New England Journal of Medicine of data from more than 30 Chinese provinces estimated the death rate at 1.4%.In Daegu, the South Korean city at the center of that country’s outbreak, a shortage of hospital space meant about 2,300 patients were being cared for in other facilities while they awaited a hospital bed. Prime Minister Chung Se-Kyun sought to assure his country, saying, “We will win the war against COVID-19.""South Korea reported 435 new infections Wednesday, down from 851 a day earlier. More than 5,600 people in South Korea have contracted the virus and 32 have died.In Europe, officials told French soccer players to simply disperse — without shaking hands — after lining up, and referees and coaches will no longer shake hands either. In Paris, the Louvre finally reopened after closing because of fears among workers about catching the virus from visitors, but it will no longer accept cash, because of the danger of germs.A news conference at Milan's Triennale contemporary art and design museum looked like an exhibit itself, with journalists' chairs spaced more than a yard (meter) apart.In Israel, the country's chief rabbi urged observant Jews to refrain from kissing the mezuza, the small box containing a prayer scroll that is posted by Jews on their doorposts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also urged people to adopt the Indian greeting of “namaste,"" with hands together, rather than a handshake.Businesses of all types suffered a downturn as travel and tourism plummeted and worried consumers changed their habits.“People are afraid to touch anything or take anything from us,"" said Maedeh Jahangiri, a perfume seller at a mall in Tehran.China reported 119 new cases Wednesday, all but five in the outbreak’s epicenter of Wuhan. In a sign of the shifting threat, Beijing’s health commissioner said two new cases in the Chinese capital were apparently infected abroad, in Iran and Italy.Doctors working in Wuhan said hospitals there have an increasing number of empty beds but cautioned there is always the possibility of a new spike of infections.“The war is not over,"" said Dr. Cao Bin, who specializes in respiratory research.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

126,"Fed says coronavirus causing disruptions, widespread concern","The coronavirus outbreak already has disrupted travel and access to goods for US industry, and businesses nationwide sounded the warning that things could get worse, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday. While activity in the world's largest economy continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace in recent weeks, the outlook was becoming more uncertain, according to the Fed's beige book survey.The report contains dozens of mentions of the virus, which said ""producers feared further disruptions in the coming weeks.""Painting a picture of widespread and growing impact, the report underscores the Fed's decision Tuesday to make an emergency interest rate cut to boost confidence and shore up the economy.""The coronavirus has entered the list of concerns, which still includes tariffs and tight labor markets,"" according to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.And in Chicago, many manufacturers ""expected a larger effect if the disruptions continued much longer.""Meanwhile, ""local customers have been avoiding some of Philadelphia's Asian restaurants and shops, as unfounded fears spread,"" the report said.Amid rising concerns about the virus and the damage to the global economy, the Fed's policy-setting committee on Tuesday slashed its key interest rate by a half point to a range of 1.0-1.25 -- the first inter-meeting cut since late 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the move was aimed ""to help the US economy keep strong in the face of new risks to the economic outlook.""But most investors expect the Fed to cut the benchmark borrowing rate again at the March 17-18 policy meeting to stem the economic uncertainty.The epidemic deflated the optimism felt after President Donald Trump signed the Phase One deal with China in January, calling a truce in the trade hostilities between the two economic powers, but leaving many tariffs in place.Transportation, tourism and manufacturing all reported impacts from the virus, as did the energy industry, since the outbreak has driven down oil prices.The Richmond Fed noted that ""several ports saw an increase in blank sailings -- that is shippers cancelling ports of call -- particularly from China.""Meanwhile, farmers in the Chicago region ""expressed frustration that Chinese purchases of US agricultural goods had not yet materialized following the announcement of the Phase One trade deal and were concerned that the coronavirus outbreak would be used as an excuse for missing future trade targets."""
127,US stocks jump as Joe Biden takes the lead,"NEW YORK :Wall Street surged on Wednesday as former Vice President Joe Biden's strong showing in the ""Super Tuesday"" primary contests gave a boost to healthcare stocks and upbeat economic data helped sooth investors' coronavirus anxieties. All three major US stock averages were at least 2.5% higher, with the S&P 500 having regained about 4.5% from Friday's closing trough, but still about 8.8% below its all-time high reached on Feb 19.Since then, the markets dove into a correction as the fast-spreading COVID-19 sparked widespread recession fears.Former Vice President Joe Biden emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination following a string of primary victories, providing relief to market participants who are wary of rival Bernie Sanders' more progressive policy positions.""Today, clearly this is a Biden surge and maybe a bit of an opportunity to play a bounce given what happened in the markets yesterday,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.This, after the US Federal Reserve's surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut to head off potential economic damage caused by the coronavirus, which has grown to 93,000 confirmed cases worldwide and rattled global markets.""There may be a re-examination going on today,"" Carlson added. ""At least the Fed is indicating that they're being supportive.""But Carlson noted the coronavirus is likely remain an overhang through the first half of the year. ""Markets don't like uncertainties and this is about as uncertain a situation as I've seen in some time,"" he said.On the economic front, data showed stronger-than-expected private sector hiring, and the services sector expanding at its fastest pace in a year, according to reports from ADP and the Institute for Supply Management, respectively.Additionally, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average 30-year fixed contract mortgage rate fell last week to a seven-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 818.85 points, or 3.16%, to 26,736.26, the S&P 500 gained 85.86 points, or 2.86%, to 3,089.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 224.57 points, or 2.59%, to 8,908.66.All of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 were firmly in the black, led by a 4.5% jump in healthcare stocks.Fourth-quarter earnings season is crossing the finish line, with 488 S&P 500 companies having reported. Of those, 70.1% have beaten consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv data.Dollar Tree Inc forecast underwhelming first-quarter sales and profit, sending the discount retailer's shares down 3.3%.Among apparel retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch Co jumped 9.3% after beating quarterly sales and profit estimates.But Nordstrom forecast 2020 profit below analyst estimates, sending its shares down 3.2%.Campbell Soup Co's beat-and-raise earnings report gave a 7.3% boost to its shares.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.98-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 31 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 115 new lows."

129,Focus on containing virus may have temporary impact on BRI,"NEW DELHI :With the Chinese government’s energies focussed on containing the Covid-19 outbreak, Indian strategic experts think it may help slow down China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), specifically in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Even if the crisis has no more than a marginal impact on the BRI, which seeks to invest about $8 trillion in infrastructure projects across Asia, Europe and Africa, Indian experts and officials believe that the damage has already been done.India has been critical of CPEC, which cuts through Gilgit and Baltistan areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Some believe that the Covid-19 outbreak may be at best a “temporary setback,"" to China’s showpiece One Belt One Road (Obor) infrastructure initiative, unveiled by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, that aims to build railways, ports and power grids across Asia, Africa and Europe.“You have a moving train that has come to a temporary halt because some repairs need to be done at the workshop. It will ultimately move and reach its destination. All we are seeing is a temporary kind of setback,"" said Alka Acharya, professor in Chinese studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.To counter Beijing, the US is seeking a bigger role for India in stabilizing and maintaining the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific region—a large swathe of land and sea stretching all the way from the west coast of the US to the shores of east Africa.“Together, we will defend our sovereignty, security, and protect a free and open Indo-Pacific region for our children and for many, many generations to come,"" US President Donald Trump said duding his recent visit to India.A pushback against BRI is taking place in the Indo-Pacific region from a grouping known as the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan. “India needs to go back to the drawing board and try to get into a space which is being redesigned. There is no zero sum game here, as everyone will be impacted by the contagion,"" Acharya said.Some analysts believe that India’s seemingly inadequate response to the crisis in China will have far wide reaching implications given the nature of relationship between the two countries.India and China recently engaged in a verbal spat over Beijing’s seeming refusal to grant New Delhi permission for an evacuation flight. China denied that there was any delay in granting permission.“This is a strategic error... Given that when you have a positive experience it gets handed down over generations, the negative experience is also more vitriolic in nature,"" said a New Delhi-based strategic affairs expert requesting anonymity.“We have to live with China in our neighbourhood. Like families, there are somethings that you never forget,"" said the New Delhi-based strategic expert and added, “China will bounce back given the demographics. They have experienced far worse kind of losses earlier.""“From the perspective of evaluating the global business cycle, we view Covid-19 as a transitory, exogenous shock as opposed to an economic slowdown which is caused by endogenous pulls and pressures of an economy that is overheating and fundamentally challenged. We remain of the view that the recovery is being delayed but not derailed,"" a Morgan Stanley report said."
130,Opinion | Diplomatic denial won’t soften CAA for the world,"Even diplomacy might not reverse the repercussions that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 or CAA continues to have beyond the loss of life, livelihood and property. A week after structured rioting in Delhi aimed at those who protest against CAA stunned the world with its brazenness and unapologetic aftermath, comes scrutiny of a different kind. The Office of United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights has filed what is called an intervention application in the Supreme Court over CAA. The intervention is the diplomatic equivalent of a slap and further globalizes, as it were, the latest incidence of CAA-related violence in particular, and the political maturity of majoritarian aggression in general. The Geneva-based office of the high commissioner, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, tacked the application onto the writ petition challenging CAA that former diplomat Deb Mukharji filed in the Supreme Court in December, one of 60 by human rights activists, politicians and political parties, including from North-East India. Bachelet Jeria wants her office to be amicus curiae, or impartial observer or ‘friendly’ advisor to the court, for the petition. The high commissioner wants to intervene with neutrality—suggesting there is need to ensure such neutrality—and, by extension, nudges the Supreme Court to do right.The government of India officially acknowledged the UN high commissioner’s plea on 3 March, when the foreign ministry put out a terse release stating that India’s permanent mission in Geneva was notified of the move a day earlier. Usual rebuttals followed: “internal matter"", “sovereign right of the Indian Parliament to make laws"", and “no foreign party has locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty"".The statement sourced to the ministry’s official spokesperson extended the rebuttal to a decidedly tricky plane that can be contested on several grounds and, indeed, forms the bedrock of anti-CAA sentiment and protests against heavy-handed politics. “We are clear that the CAA is constitutionally valid,"" the spokesperson declared, “and complies with all requirements of our constitutional values."" The ministry then extended its political neck. “We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position would be vindicated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court"" which is part of “our independent judiciary"".That will likely fly in India, which is in any case the political marketplace for CAA and its controversial associates, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register. But India will have a harder time explaining away Bachelet Jeria’s impeccably worded, grounded and quite deliberate intervention. And, even as it marks the former Chilean president’s independent streak, it also morally weakens India’s current membership of the UN’s Human Rights Council. Much like the petitioners who question CAA, the high commissioner decried the “narrow scope of the CAA"". Her office also highlighted another aspect, that “in light of the broad prohibition of refoulement""—the forcible return of asylum seekers or refugees and the possibility of continued persecution—CAA “may not be sufficiently objective and reasonable … under international human rights law.""In other words, as CAA excludes Muslims, even those Muslim sects persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, it distorts the parameters that ought to be in “accordance with international human rights law, including the right to equality before the law, equal protection of the law, and the right to non-discrimination and the absolute and non-derogable principle of non-refoulement.""Bachelet Jeria is within her rights to intervene—by a resolution adopted by UN General Assembly in January 1994. Resolution 48/141 created the post of the high commissioner for human rights. Among other things, it also empowered the high commissioner “to play an active role in removing the current obstacles and in meeting the challenges to the full realization of all human rights and in preventing the continuation of human rights violations throughout the world, as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action"" and “To engage in a dialogue with all Governments in the implementation of his/her mandate with a view to securing respect for all human rights …""Various governments of India have displayed a patchy, even disastrous, human rights record across the country against its own citizens, that mocked India’s signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the 1940s. In that, the current government is not an exception. But it does function in a world that increasingly views India as having joined the ranks of countries where majoritarian stick is the schtick.This column focuses on conflict situations and the convergence of businesses and human rights and runs on Thursdays."
131,Supreme Court lifts curbs on cryptos but risks remain an issue,"In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had barred regulated entities such as banks from dealing in bitcoins and other virtual currencies. The Supreme Court has now lifted the restriction. Mint analyses the financial risks associated with cryptocurrencies. What exactly are cryptocurrencies?Cryptocurrencies are internet-based mediums of exchange. They are digital currencies that can be exchanged between parties without the need of a third entity, like a bank. Many of them use a decentralized blockchain—an encrypted ledger for storing information. Over 3,000 crypto assets have entered the digital currency market since 2008. They are decentralized rather than being under the control of any nation or company. This can often lower transaction costs for global payments compared to financial messaging systems such as SWIFT, used for making transactions in different currencies.Do cryptocurrencies carry a lot of risk?Cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to cyber hacking and data privacy breaches and increase the risk of money laundering. They do not have any fundamental value as they are not legal tender, and are not backed by governments, central banks or a pool of assets. This reduces trust in them, which is necessary for a credible medium of exchange. They are a poor medium of exchange also because their valuation tends to be excessively volatile and susceptible to manipulation. They are seen as instruments of speculation and transactions that are below the radar of regulators and law enforcement agencies.Graphic by Paras Jain/Mint  Are state-backed digital coins a better option?Yes, as state-backed digital coins can combine the positives of digital and sovereign currencies. RBI has no plans to introduce digital coins, but China is likely to launch the Digital Currency Electronic Payment and Central Bank Digital Currency. Russia has been working on a state-backed cryptoruble. Sweden has its e-krona project.Why is RBI worried about cryptos?Since 2013, RBI has been warning about the risks associated with virtual currencies. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it is not clear who is the lender of last resort, or who people should turn to if there is fraud or abuse of monopoly power. If cash issued by central banks or fiat currencies and retail deposits held with banks get shifted on a large scale to digital currencies, the effectiveness of monetary policy can erode. It may also trigger rupee depreciation. If they lead to capital flight, financial stability could be at risk.What is the future of such currencies?Central banks may begin to strictly regulate virtual currencies. Dominance of the US dollar in the international trade and monetary system will weaken. Instead of accepting dollars as the settlement currency for trade, users may choose from a variety of currencies. Sovereign currencies may coexist with cryptocurrencies, digital currencies issued by central banks and private dollar-centric digital ones launched by private parties such as Facebook’s Libra.Puja Mehra is a Delhi-based journalist."
132,Production of diesel vehicles may fall to lowest in a decade,"MUMBAI :With new emission norms driving up prices of diesel cars and market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd exiting the segment, the share of diesel vehicles in India’s total passenger vehicle production may fall to the lowest level in a decade in 2020, global information provider IHS Markit said. Among passenger vehicles with gross weight up to 3.5 tonnes to be produced in India in 2020, only 18.5% will be diesel, down from a record 47% in 2013, IHS said in a forecast. The data includes export volumes and domestic sales.“Drop in the production of diesel cars would be prominent in the A+, B and B+ segments, which can also be categorized as the passenger vehicles shorter than four metres in length. However, despite losing some volumes to petrol, utility vehicles larger than 4 metres would predominantly remain diesel,"" Suraj Ghosh, principal analyst (powertrain forecast), IHS Markit, said in an interview.Competitors will try to take full advantage of Maruti’s no-diesel period to expand their diesel volumes, Ghosh added.About 23% of Maruti’s 1.7 million passenger vehicles sold in India last fiscal year were diesel models. Diesel vehicles in BS-VI regime could cost 10-12% more due to new technology and additional critical parts. In contrast, petrol cars cost just  ₹20,000-25,000 more.“Per-kilometer running cost for a CNG car is nearly half of that of a diesel car. A CNG vehicle makes more economic sense than diesel. Therefore, there is no reason why people would not adopt CNG if it is making economic sense,"" Maruti Suzuki’s senior executive director (engineering), C.V. Raman said, justifying the company’s decision to vacate the diesel segment.However, Hyundai Motor India Ltd has spotted an opportunity in Maruti’s exit. India’s second largest carmaker, which saw diesel-to-petrol mix of 30:70 in 2019, expects the share of diesel vehicles to rise in 2020. However, two people familiar with the matter said this would depend on the impact of supply chain disruptions due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The company declined to make an official comment on its fuel mix for this year.Still, Hyundai remains bullish on increasing sales of diesel cars led by the BS-VI-compliant 1.2 liter and 1.5 liter diesel engines.Meanwhile, attempting to balance its diesel-heavy portfolio to prepare for BS-VI, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) has discontinued its 1.2 liter diesel engine and has developed an all-new mStallion family of petrol engines across 1.2 liter, 1.5 liter and 2 liter displacements. These engines will also be deployed for SsangYong and Ford vehicles in an attempt to spread out development costs.M&M has only one petrol engine currently, 1.2 liter, which powers its compact sports utility vehicle XUV300. Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M, said: “Over the years, M&M has predominantly been a diesel manufacturer. With the launch of XUV300, we had planned to introduce our first major offering in the gasoline segment. The petrol variant contributes over 30% of total XUV300 sales. In fact, in metro markets, such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, our petrol share has already grown to 50%-plus in recent months.""Tata Motors Ltd declined to comment. A spokesperson of Ford India Pvt. Ltd, which retains diesel variants across its BS-VI portfolio, said the fuel mix could tilt towards petrol due to non-availability of some popular models in diesel."
133,PEs may be new promoters as buyout deals set to define the decade,"MUMBAI :Private equity firms (PE) are likely to emerge as a new breed of promoters of Indian businesses in the next decade as they gravitate to buyout deals, experts at the Mint India Investment Summit 2020 said. “Every decade has a different growth story to tell. So, there will be different growth drivers and different sectors that will drive growth. Today, buyouts as a segment has gone up to nearly a third of all private equity investments as against the last decade when they were probably just about 7-8%,"" said Neha Grover, regional lead for disruptive technologies and PE funds group at IFC-South Asia.“So, we will see different pockets of growth. It is a matter of just finding those pockets and gainfully investing in them,"" Grover said at a panel discussion on the future of PE funds in India.Buyouts have been on an uptrend over the past four-five years, growing more than five times in value since 2016, which had recorded $3 billion worth of such deals. Last year, buyout deals accounted for 34% of all PE/VC (venture capital) investments by value in 2019—the highest it has ever been, according to data from EY. In the past two years, buyouts clocked $26.7 billion in deal value, which is more than the value of buyouts in the preceding 12 years combined.Watch: Mint Investment Summit: Private Equity in India amid slowdown, Coronavirus  The changing investment pattern is partly because of their experience in the Indian market and partly because they want to be in control of their exits.“I always say that investment is only 25% of our job done, the balance is building the company over the next four-five years and then selling it right,"" said Shweta Jalan, managing director of Advent International.“If an investor behaves like a mutual fund and just sits for the board meetings, then there would be no value addition,"" she said. “We believe that the money we invest adds significant value to the company, which is differentiated capital, not the monetary capital, and that is what we try to bring to the table by managing the company.""The increase in buyout deals is also driven by the change in the mindset of Indian promoters. “Traditionally, there was a belief that debt is cheaper than equity because of which promoters were reluctant to dilute their stakes. But the promoter mindset is now changing,"" said Parth Gandhi, senior partner and managing director at AION India Investment Advisors. The introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), he said, is one of the biggest contributors to that change.“There is some amount of tempering of debt and the beliefs are changing. Today, the promoter is conscious of the fact that, in principle, if he keeps on taking debt, he may end up losing control of the company,"" said Gandhi.That has led to higher buyouts happening in traditional Indian firms, said Nitish Poddar, partner and national leader-private equity at KPMG in India.“A private equity fund would be happy to take a minority stake in a company led by a first-generation entrepreneur, but for traditional businesses, there are issues of leveraging and the banks would be involved, and there, it makes more sense to buy a controlling stake.""But overleveraging the business, according to Sandeep Naik, managing director and head of India and SouthEast Asia at General Atlantic, is more common among traditional businesses than new-age companies.“Expanding a company or starting adjacent business using debt was common with traditionally run companies with the expectation that the earnings would grow and the debt will be paid back,"" Naik said. “The new generation of tech companies are dealing with it much better, and there will be lesser debt-related issues in these companies. The challenge with these companies is that of high valuations.""“There is about $1.5 trillion worth dry powder with private equity firms right now and almost half of it is trying to chase growth markets. India continues to be a growth market, and with that kind of capital trying to chase growth companies, valuations continue to be high and that is becoming a problem,"" he added.As PE firms become the new promoters of Indian companies, due diligence will become an important cog in the buyout process.“Going forward, there will be some sort of segregation, where buyout funds with the sort of experience they have will focus more on buying businesses, which they think they can run,"" said Nishant Parikh, partner at Trilegal.“There are a lot of businesses that cannot be run or bought out by private equity firms, and while the boundaries of that keep shifting, the documentation and diligence continue to be more focused and robust,"" he added."
134,Govt okays proposal permitting NRIs to own 100% stake in Air India,"NEW DELHI :The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to let non-resident Indians (NRIs) own up to a 100% stake in Air India Ltd as the government attempts to make a success of its second attempt to completely privatize the debt-laden airline. The cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved an amendment to the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy to permit FDI in Air India by NRIs up to 100% under the automatic route, the government said.The government, which aims to divest its entire stake in Air India, last month began the stake sale process by inviting offers from potential investors after a costly turnaround plan and an earlier effort to sell a controlling stake in the flag carrier failed. To sweeten the deal, the Centre has also reduced Air India’s debt from about  ₹56,334 crore to about  ₹23,287 crore.The cabinet decision will give the government more flexibility to receive bids for Air India, said Dev Raj Singh, executive director at EY India.“Under the existing policy, NRIs/ OCIs (Overseas Citizens of India) are permitted to invest under automatic route up to 100% in scheduled air transport services. The investment limit including NRIs, in Air India was restricted to 49%, which has now been aligned with the existing policy for investment by NRI in the civil aviation sector,"" Singh said.Air India failed to attract a single bid last year when the government decided to sell a portion of its stake.This time, the list of potential bidders include UK-based Hinduja group, Tata group and IndiGo, according to media reports.Tata SIA Airlines Ltd, a joint venture between Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, which operates Vistara, is evaluating the prospects of bidding for Air India, its chairman Bhaskar Bhat said recently.Air India has 128 aircraft in its fleet, according to its website, while its subsidiaries Air India Express and Alliance Air have 25 and 19 planes, respectively.The airline has 9,426 permanent workers, 4,201 contract employees, and 2,867 employees on deputation.rhik.k@livemint.com"
135,"Infosys, TCS  order books  face  twin test of coronavirus and low rates","IT stocks have fluctuated wildly in the past six months. They first underperformed the broad market as IT companies did not really gain from a cut in corporate taxes announced in September. Then, since December, they began recouping most of the losses as a result of worries about the domestic economy that drove down other stocks and also because of the confidence about healthy order books. Infosys Ltd reported a 56% jump in large deal wins in the nine months to December, offering growth visibility. Softness in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) business vertical aside, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) booked contracts worth $6 billion in BFSI in the same period.However, with Covid-19 rearing its ugly head and the global economy facing renewed pressures, IT stocks are on the decline again. Analysts have begun flagging risks to IT companies, though they are not pressing the alarm bells yet.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warns that global economic growth can almost halve in 2020 if the virus epidemic deepens. The US 10-year Treasury yields dropped below 1% for the first time ever over fears of a supply shock to the global economy.Graphic by Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint  To cushion the impact of global slowdown, many expect the US central bank to cut policy rates again this year. However, record low interest rates and a downtrend in bond yields can weigh on fixed income industry, posing growth headwinds for banking and insurance clients, warns Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.The silver lining is that the order backlog will cushion companies from sudden disruptions. However, business uncertainty can slow execution. “We believe one of the key things to watch out for would be management commentary on ramp up of the large deals won. In the past stressed macro situations, customers had pulled back on execution of large contracts as they saw impending pressure on their financials,"" said Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities in a note.Travel restrictions can also pose challenges to the service capabilities of Indian IT firms and new deal wins. Industry events that foster business development are taking a hit. The cancellation of this year’s Mobile World Congress is a case in point.The slowdown in global travel, hospitality and consumer retail sectors can have a noticeable impact on small and medium-sized firms such as NIIT Technologies Ltd, Hexaware Technologies Ltd and Mindtree Ltd as they have a higher exposure to these industries, warn analysts.Companies are still assessing the impact. A compilation of global corporations’ commentary by Kotak Institutional Equities shows only a marginal impact to their sales so far.However, if the virus disruption lasts longer, clients will be forced to rethink on IT spends. That is the risk investors should take into account. “A short period of uncertainty (say a month) will limit the impact on business. However, extended impact can lead to discussion on IT spending curtailment,"" says analysts at Kotak."
136,"To end losses, Airbus pushes A220 suppliers to slash costs on parts","LONDON/NEW YORK/FRANKFURT :Airbus SE is pushing suppliers on its A220 jetliner programme to renegotiate contracts and reduce the price of parts to help slash costs and turn the former Bombardier Inc. model profitable. Safran SA said it’s in talks with Airbus to trim expenses in the A220’s cabin, while engine producer Pratt & Whitney and partner MTU Aero Engines AG have agreed to deliver a 10% saving, people with knowledge of the plan said. Senior Plc says it could win more work by pitching production at low-cost sites.Airbus is pressing for cost reductions against expectations of higher A220 sales as it brings to bear a formidable marketing machine and offers the model alongside its in-house A320-series narrow-body. The grounding of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max has also presented a chance to grab more of the single-aisle market.“Airbus are clearly a lot more confident in their ability to sell the A220,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Benjamin Heelan. “Being able to go to suppliers with higher medium term volumes is a big lever to get costs down.""Airbus is striving to reach break even on the A220 after paying Montreal-based Bombardier $591 million to lift its stake to 75%. While the jet’s composite wings, airy cabin and state-of-the-art cockpit make it a technological leader, Airbus Canada head Philippe Balducchi said in January that overall costs need to be reduced by “a significant double-digit"" percentage.A spokeswoman for Toulouse, France-based Airbus said significant progress has been made with some suppliers but that it remains in talks with others. The firm will invest as much as $1.1 billion in the A220 this year.Some savings could come from looking at component design or increasing commonality with the A320, according to the people familiar with the plans, who asked not to be named discussing the changes. Airbus’s leverage with suppliers may be high right now because many also serve Boeing, where the Max crisis has stunted demand.Safran chief executive officer Philippe Petitcolin said on a call Thursday that the challenge is to cut costs without compromising on the quality of the jet’s interior. The Paris-based group supplies the A220’s seats, galleys, lavatories and overhead storage bins, as well as oxygen, waste-removal, water and sound-insulation systems.A spokeswoman for Munich-based MTU referred questions to Pratt & Whitney. A representative for United Technologies Corp., which owns Pratt and Collins Aerospace, declined to comment. Collins is another major supplier on the plane, providing onboard computers, electrical power supplies and actuators that control wing flaps.Senior CEO David Squires said in an interview Monday the UK firm is also in talks with Airbus to pare A220 costs. While it now provides air-conditioning systems and ducting, the recalibration may present an opportunity to bid for aerostructures work via its lower-cost southeast Asian operation, he said.Airbus will most likely revisit the entire A220 supply chain, BAML’s Heelan said, as it targets mid-2020s output of 10 jets a month at the former Bombardier plant in Mirabel, near Montreal, and four at Airbus’ site in Mobile, Alabama.Bombardier, which spent $6 billion on the A220, originally sought break-even this year, but said 16 January the goal had slipped, prompting an exit from the jet sealed this month when Airbus bought its remaining stake.In a sign of the competitive advantage the model offers, Airbus on 13 February secured an order from Nigerian startup Green Africa Airways that appears to threaten an existing accord for the Boeing Max.Airlines including Air France-KLM have also expressed an interest in a larger, 160-seat-plus A220. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said last month that it’s not currently working on a stretch model but sees that as a likely development. "
137,"Saudi Arabia wants Opec, allies to cut oil output by over 1 mn barrels per day","DUBAI/LONDON/CAIRO :Saudi Arabia is urging Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries+ (Opec+) to agree to an oil-output cut of more than 1 million barrels a day to compensate for the hit to demand from the global spread of the coronavirus. Options discussed by ministers in Vienna on Wednesday included a reduction as big as 1.5 million barrels a day, but the talks were still underway and there was no agreement yet, said delegates, who asked not to be named because the talks were private. To secure a supply curb that could support prices, the Saudis must first overcome Russian resistance.The kingdom’s push reflects mounting concern that growth in fuel consumption could be wiped out this year as the outbreak wreaks havoc on the world economy.Following oil’s biggest weekly slump since the 2008 financial crisis, ministers from the Opec and its allies must overcome their differences to forge a deal, while also grappling with the risks of bringing together delegations from 23 nations as the deadly disease continues to spread.Iranian oil minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, whose country is enduring a severe coronavirus outbreak, arrived in the Austrian capital on Wednesday without his usual cohort of government officials. He refused to be drawn on the possible extent of production curbs, and said Russia is likely to wait until the last moment to make any decision.The cut under discussion in the Austrian capital is larger than that put forward by the group’s technical committee on Tuesday. The panel recommended a 600,000 to 1 million-barrel-a-day reduction in the second quarter, more ambitious than curbs mooted in February but still short of some estimates of the demand loss. Equatorial Guinea’s minister of mines, industry and energy Gabriel Obiang Lima told reporters that he supports a cut at the higher end of that range. Crude jumped as much as 2.6% in New York and traded at $48 a barrel as of 10:36 a.m. Prices slumped 16% last week, and remain too low for most Opec+ members to balance their budgets.With flights cancelled in Europe, schools closed in Japan, towns quarantined in Italy and a rising death toll from Iran to Washington state, the coronavirus crisis has gone global, and with it, its impact on energy demand. For only the fourth time in almost 40 years, oil consumption may not grow at all in 2020, according to a growing minority of traders, investors and analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Tuesday became the first major Wall Street Bank to forecast a contraction in demand this year.“This is a sudden, instant demand shock,"" said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of oil markets at IHS Markit Ltd. “The scale of the decline is unprecedented.""In an effort to limit potential contagion as officials arrived in Vienna, Opec said medical advisers would conduct screenings to detect staff or delegates who might have high temperatures. Some employees will be told to work from home. Opec told national delegations to limit their size to the “bare minimum,"" pressing ahead with the meeting even as conferences across the globe were cancelled.Amid the difficult circumstances, Opec secretary-general Mohammad Barkindo and Russian energy minister Alexander Novak sought a moment of levity, posting on Twitter a video of themselves performing a handshake with their feet, in keeping with guidelines to avoid bodily contact that could spread the virus."
138,"Government eases penalties, makes compliance simpler for India Inc","NEW  DELHI :The government on Wednesday cleared a raft of measures aimed at improving ease of doing business, including a moderate penalty regime for all offences barring grave ones, allowing companies to list overseas and the freedom to offer independent directors higher remuneration.  The revamp of the Companies Act, 2013, cleared by the Union cabinet, seeks to make compliance less rigorous for companies and attract foreign investments at a time the economy is going through a slowdown. The move is set to complement a low corporate tax rate regime rolled out in September.The cabinet cleared 72 amendments to the Companies Act, 2013, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters, adding that the proposed changes will make the law “more humane"". A bill to amend the Act is likely to be moved in Parliament during the current session to give effect to the changes.The amendments seek to usher in a new regulatory architecture by moderating penalties for 52 of the 136 penal provisions that are there included in the Act after an earlier effort to decriminalize them in 2019. The proposals include reclassifying 23 compoundable offences to be handled under an in-house adjudication system of registrars of companies, dropping seven compoundable offences, removing imprisonment for 11 others, lowering penalties in the case of six others and allowing five others to be handled under alternative frameworks, explained an official statement. The cabinet also decided to expand the scope of lower penalties for small companies and one-person companies to cover all defaults as well as for startups and producer companies. The amount of penalty will also be capped. Allowing direct listing of public limited companies in select foreign markets will allow new-age companies with disruptive business models to raise capital abroad if they feel domestic investors are taking time to develop interest in them or to have the risk appetite, a government official said on condition of anonymity. “Such companies can get listed abroad on their own strength,"" said the official. Finer details about the market as well as the class of companies to be allowed under the scheme will be notified as rules.Sitharaman said a ministerial panel had studied sections of the Companies Act that were troubling businesses. “Majority of the changes are to remove criminality of the offences where no mala fide is intended. The major thrust is to improve the ease of doing business and to decriminalize the law,"" the minister said.Besides these, a lot of steps are being taken to improve compliance, said Sitharaman. One key step is exempting companies, which have an obligation to spend  ₹50 lakh or less, from the requirement of having a corporate social responsibility committee.“Also, if a company has spent more than 2% of net profit in one year, the general approach was to count only 2% under this obligation. Now, we are allowing the excess amount spent to be carried over to be adjusted against the obligation of subsequent years,"" the minister said.The proposals also include allowing companies with inadequate profits to offer remuneration to independent directors the way executive directors are rewarded. At present, managerial remuneration is capped at 11% of net profit and if a company needs to spend more, it needs shareholders’ approval. In the case of a company that has defaulted on loans, lenders’ approval is also needed. The same rules will now apply for the remuneration of independent directors once the changes become law, allowing firms to spend more to retain talent.  Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of Confederation of Indian Industry, said the steps will further the ease of living for law-abiding corporate houses and unclog the criminal justice system. “Importantly, it establishes the trust factor in business and industry that is essential for a healthy ecosystem,"" he said in a statement. "
139,"Oyo cuts 5,000 jobs, scales back China ambitions as troubles mount","Hotel startup Oyo is making a significant reduction in its workforce, as it looks to cut costs amid investor scepticism about its headlong expansion and the outbreak of Covid-19 in China, its second-largest market. Oyo is cutting 5,000 jobs in India, the US, China and Japan, with the most reductions in China, two people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The number includes 1,200 people in India, who were fired in phases between December and February.The job cuts at Oyo were earlier reported by Bloomberg, which cited an interview with chief executive Ritesh Agarwal. According to Bloomberg, Oyo will now employ about 25,000 people.Oyo declined to comment on queries sent by Mint.The job cuts, the heaviest by an Indian unicorn in recent years, are the latest sign of trouble at Oyo.The company’s valuation had soared to $10 billion late last year from $850 million in September 2017 on the back of a market grab in India that decimated rivals and an expansion spree in international markets, including China and the US. The expansion, largely funded by SoftBank, led to deep losses. Though revenue jumped to $951 million in 2018-19 from $211 million in the previous year, losses swelled to around $335 million in the same year from $44 million in FY18.These numbers didn’t come as a shock to Oyo investors, but in the post-WeWork environment, Oyo has been forced to change course. Rather than continuing with the market-grab strategy, the company is now looking to increase occupancy rates, cut loss-making properties and prove that its business model can yield profits.Oyo has also faced a deluge of complaints from hotel partners in India, some of which have claimed that the firm has delayed payments and reneged on promises. In December, Oyo replaced Aditya Ghosh, CEO of its Indian and South Asia business, with Rohit Kapoor, a former McKinsey partner who had joined the company in 2018. Ghosh joined the board of directors at Oyo. Though Oyo portrayed Ghosh’s move as an elevation, it was clear that his one-year tenure had been a disappointment.The company is also facing an antitrust probe in India over its exclusive partnership with Makemytrip that allegedly breaks competition rules.Oyo’s troubles mirror the problems of its largest investor, SoftBank. After WeWork’s stalled public share sale and the disappointing market debut of Uber last year, SoftBank has been widely criticized for its freewheeling investment strategy. The Japanese firm is struggling to raise its second Vision Fund.SoftBank’s troubles have raised questions about Oyo’s ability to secure additional capital at its present valuation of $10 billion or higher.“Oyo will certainly need to raise more capital within a year,"" an investor familiar with Oyo’s plans said on condition of anonymity. “If SoftBank isn’t able to put more money, they will have to accept a big down round."" Down round refers to a subsequent funding round that occurs at a lower valuation than a firm’s previous fundraise.Oyo’s future in China looks especially bleak. Its job cuts there have been triggered by the virus outbreak, but the company has had a tough time there from the start. Though Oyo established itself as the second-largest hotel chain in China last year with 9,000 properties, the firm faced rampant fraud across its properties as it lacked controls and processes. To clamp down on fraud and raise occupancy rates, Oyo had to launch a new model called Oyo 2.0 in May 2019 for its China hotel suppliers."
140,Opinion | A deal in danger,"The much-touted deal between the US and the Taliban already looks set to unravel. A big sign of it coming unstuck appeared on Wednesday, when US forces carried out air strikes on insurgents associated with the group in retaliation for attacks on Afghan forces in Helmand province a day before. Oddly enough, the US action came just hours after President Donald Trump said he had had a “very good talk"" with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the political chief of the Taliban. The 29 February deal was aimed at bringing peace to Afghanistan and thus helping the US extricate itself from a long and costly war that began in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. Many saw the deal as a US surrender, as it envisaged a phased withdrawal of American and allied forces over 14 months. Elements in the Taliban may even have celebrated the US exit as a victory. The air strikes were perhaps intended as a signal of Trump’s resolve to stick it out in Afghanistan if the Taliban failed to keep their end of the bargain. The group has been at odds with the Afghan government over prisoner swaps. It may even want to regain control of the country. That would be terrible"
141,IMF chief calls for an all-out response to curb Covid-19,"WASHINGTON :IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday called for an all-out, “no regrets"" response to the new coronavirus epidemic which poses a “serious threat"" to the global economy. “At a time of uncertainty... it is better to do more than to do not enough,"" she said, warning that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak will slow growth in the world economy to below the 2.9% posted last year.The epidemic “is no longer a regional issue, it is a global problem calling for global response,"" Georgieva told reporters.The virus has shuttered factories, disrupted travel, infected over 93,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,200, mainly in China, while some countries are struggling to test for and contain the spread of the illness.That has spurred global policymakers to come out in force to mitigate the damage, including an emergency, half-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, followed by a similar cut by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday.While some economists argue lower interest rates will do little to help address interruptions in supply chains, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it should provide a boost to confidence.And while Georgieva said the global financial system is in good shape now after being fortified in the wake of the 2008 crisis, “We do need to have measures that are bringing a sense of confidence,"" and prevent credit from freezing up.The epidemic’s impact on confidence and demand, as well as the steps imposed to contain it, are impacting economic activity, with the result that “global growth in 2020 will dip below last year’s levels,"" she said.The IMF in January forecast growth this year of 3.3%, which means at least a half point will be lost to the virus. But “how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict,"" she said.Georgieva said the fund’s analysis had assumed the virus would be largely confined to China, which would have led to a sharp but short economic slowdown, followed by a quick recovery.“Unfortunately over the last week we’ve seen a shift to a more adverse scenario for the global economy,"" due to the “sheer geographic spread of the epidemic around the world,"" impacting a third of the IMF’s 189 member countries.The fund is due to release its updated forecasts in mid-April.Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass spoke to reporters after a conference call of finance officials from member nations, who directed the IMF “to use all its available financing instruments to help member countries in need.""“We are determined to provide the necessary support to mitigate the impact, especially on the most vulnerable people and countries,"" the statement from governing body the IMFC said.Georgieva said the Washington-based development lender has $1 trillion in overall financing capacity, including $50 billion available without a formal IMF programme, and $10 billion in no-interest funds for the poorest countries."
142,"Bank of Canada follows Fed, cuts benchmark rate by 50 basis points","OTTAWA :The Bank of Canada cut half a percentage point from its benchmark interest rate Wednesday, easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years as it followed the Federal Reserve in trying to protect its economy from the Covid-19. The central bank lowered its overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% and said the spread of the coronavirus represents a “material negative shock"" to the Canadian and global outlooks. Officials said they’ll act again to reduce rates if necessary.“Governing council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target,"" policy makers said in a statement, adding the move is part of a global response to the crisis.The cut marks a reversal for governor Stephen Poloz, whose prolonged resistance to lowering borrowing costs left the country with the highest policy rate among advanced economies.His position became increasingly untenable with the rout in global equities on concern the spread of the coronavirus could touch off a worldwide slowdown.Policy makers were quick to highlight why a 50-basis-point cut, the first since the 2008-2009 recession, was necessary, saying “the outlook is clearly weaker now than it was in January.""Poloz is due to speak Thursday in Toronto to provide insight into the decision. The bank’s next meeting is 15 April.“Fifty basis points is a very strong message from the Bank of Canada,"" Frances Donald, chief economist of Manulife Investment Management, said on BNN Bloomberg.“They are clearly concerned about downside risks. I suspect that this is in conjunction with globally coordinated rate cuts"" and that “we will continue to see global central banks preemptively react to the downside risks created by the coronavirus,"" she said.The virus has driven economic activity down sharply in some regions, disrupted supply chains, pulled down commodity prices and prompted a repricing of risk that has tightened financial conditions, policy makers said, warning the situation could worsen.“It is likely that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate, further depressing activity,"" they said.Several domestic factors are also weighing on first-quarter growth, including rail blockades, winter storms, weaker than expected business investment and a teachers strike in Ontario, the bank said.The move is part of an anticipated wave of easing from central banks around the world, and follows the Fed’s emergency decision on Tuesday to cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point.Today’s cut still leaves the Bank of Canada with the highest policy rate among Group of Seven countries, and 12.5 basis points above the Fed’s rate.The shift was expected. In trading Tuesday, markets assigned better than even odds Poloz would match the half-point of the Fed. That’s an abrupt change from last week when odds of even a 25-basis-point cut sat at just 30%.Of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 30 predicted at least a 25-basis-point reduction, and half of those called for the full 50 points."
143,"HSBC files winding up plea against IL&FS unit to recover dues worth  ₹1,060 crore","MUMBAI :The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC) Ltd has moved a winding-up petition against a subsidiary of IL&FS Transport Services Ltd (ITNL) in a Singapore court to recover dues of  ₹1,060 crore, information from the Singapore government gazette showed. HSBC is seeking to recover its investment in ITNL Offshore Pte. Ltd’s bonds maturing in 2021, this is the first such case against the firm filed by an overseas lender. The case will be heard on 20 March.ITNL, a part of the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) , owes  ₹40,000 crore to lenders. The group-level debt stands at  ₹1 trillion. The Centre, through the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), had taken over the management of the group in October 2018. Following the move, Indian lenders did not initiate insolvency proceedings against any IL&FS group company.""The Company is engaging with Bondholders and aims to arrive at an amicable solution to resolve their debt,"" said a spokesperson for IL&FS in an email.The government has time to intervene in the proceedings to ensure the rights of the Indian lenders are not compromised due to the winding-up petition.The problems for ITNL are likely to compound as a forensic report has found suspected money laundering of  ₹6,500 crore by the former management of its parent company.The report found that in 14 special purpose vehicles (SPVs), there were deliberate cost overruns through some shell structures, said an official from an enforcement agency, requesting anonymity.On Wednesday, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal also dismissed a plea filed by the auditors of IL&FS Financial Services (IFIN)—Deloitte Haskin and Sells (Deloitte India) and BSR Co (KPMG affiliate) —against the five-year ban imposed by the MCA."
144,Opinion | Services may not lead an economic recovery,"Amid the economic gloom worldwide on account of the deadly Covid-19 going global, there is some encouraging news for India. The services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which is an early gauge of activity levels in the sector, rose in February to its highest in more than seven years. The jump reflects a surge in new orders and improved export demand. Business confidence appears to have gone up in this sector. In this, India seems to have bucked a global recessionary trend. In China and Hong Kong, similar indices have slumped to all-time lows. Anxiety over Covid-19 has dampened business in various other countries, too. Australia and Japan have registered marked slowdowns, and service markets elsewhere are unlikely to escape unscathed. Against this backdrop, India’s services sector might look like a bright spot. The government may even be tempted to cite the PMI figure as fresh evidence to back its view that the Indian economy is no longer on a downtrend. Whether such a case can justifiably be made, however, is far from clear. Caution is also warranted because PMI readings are based on a survey of businesses and their outlook for the future, and the optimism expressed by them is not always a reliable predictor of how things actually work out. What matters is actual output—which occurs once managers put corporate money where their mouth is—and the predictive power of the index in question has displayed an uneven record in India over the recent past. Though PMI trends have pointed to a recovery for some months, this has not translated into faster economic growth as recorded by official gross domestic product (GDP) statistics for the sector. Admittedly, one cannot quite compare the two, as the two metrics cover differing subsets within services. Also, the time gaps between orders placed and income generated usually varies from one market to another. Nevertheless, the wide divergence in trends makes space for scepticism. The index’s February survey may also have been conducted before the latest worries over Covid-19 surfaced. Uncertainty now looms large over the impact of the disease on the economy and it seems unlikely that services overall would be able to hold up if customers of various inessential services begin to retreat into safety mode. Travel and tourism are likely to be struck, as also allied industries such as hospitality and a host of others that depend on leisure or discretionary spending. Commercial activities that involve gatherings would probably suffer as perceptions of risk rise. This is the nub of the problem. Regardless of how bad the epidemic gets or how far it spreads, waves of fear could ripple around and compress demand.Among services, however, the most crucial is undoubtedly the financial sector. Broader economic growth depends to a large extent on how this one performs. The story here remains disappointing, unfortunately. Credit growth has been languishing under 10%, while it arguably needs to be far higher than that for India’s economy to expand the way it did in its boom years. The country’s bad loan problem persists and bank balance sheets are yet to be cleared up, even as lenders have apparently turned risk-averse. Services account for three-fifths of the country’s GDP and if they are to form a lever that could lift everyone’s economic prospects, we need a lending revival. This may take longer if a large number of state-owned banks with varied software platforms are distracted by the internal nitty-gritties of merging operations."
145,Opinion | A judgement that balances power and proportionality,"In a judgement on Wednesday spanning elements as diverse as Vedic philosophy and cypherpunks, Jain parables and the history of central banking, the Supreme Court set aside a circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banning entities regulated by it from dealing in virtual currencies. Rich with details on the character of virtual currencies and their manner of regulation, as also the power and role of RBI, the judgement provides learnings on proportionality in regulatory response and governance. The top court acknowledged RBI’s pre-emptive as well as reactive powers to regulate virtual currencies, but held that such powers should be exercised by demonstrating the harm sought to be addressed or mitigated through its action. The judgement has set the stage for RBI to recalibrate its policy response towards the regulation of virtual currencies in a way so as to address potential consumer protection issues and systemic financial stability issues, as well as cybersecurity issues. Regulating rather than banning virtual currencies presents an opportunity for RBI to explore their potential in the present environment, more so at a time when the International Monetary Fund has advocated that central banks issue digital currency themselves. Most of all, one hopes that the judgement will foster the evolution of better regulatory governance on the part of RBI, such that any regulatory action on its part is backed by empirical data and a cost-benefit analysis of why the regulation is required and how it is likely to mitigate the stated risk.The circular in question through which it banned entities regulated by it—banks, non-banking finance companies and payment and settlement systems—from providing any service with respect to the purchase and sale of virtual currencies was issued by RBI on 5 April 2018. It is, however, useful to remember RBI’s earlier foresight on the regulation of financial technology. RBI issued guidelines on internet banking way back in 2001, with several prescient features, such as two-factor authentication. A more recent example is that of the regulatory sandbox, where it inducted the very first cohort. RBI has often been ahead of the curve in encouraging the use of digital and other technologies in finance, and their regulation.Indeed, the top court in its judgement also acknowledged that RBI could not have been accused of non-application of mind. RBI had taken cognisance of virtual currencies and the technology that underlies them as early as June 2013, and had factored in multiple considerations on the risks and attendant regulation, including those raised by the Financial Action Task Force and the Bank of international Settlements. The Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, which was established by RBI, has, in fact, put out a white paper on the potential of the use of blockchain technology, on which virtual currencies are predicated.The Supreme Court examined international precedents to determine the character of virtual currencies—scanning the definition and usage of the term in the statutes of 18 different countries and nine US states—and arrived at the conclusion that governments and regulators realize that virtual currencies are capable of being traded as real money and perform the role of legal tender, but they are in “denial mode"".The apex court relied on an analysis of the nature and role of virtual currencies, but also acknowledged that RBI was the sole repository of the power to regulate them, even if they did not have all the features of money (medium of exchange; unit of exchange, store of value, and final discharge of debt). The top court had no doubt or ambiguity on the power of RBI to regulate virtual currencies, given its overall power to operate India’s currency, credit and payment systems. It even reinforced RBI’s special role in the economy. It is with respect to the manner in which RBI’s powers are exercised that the top court made an argument about proportionality. It held that RBI did not demonstrate how banks, other financial firms and payment systems suffered any adverse impact to justify the ban.In several developed jurisdictions, it is considered a good practice to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and place this in the public domain before any regulation is framed. Similarly, an impact analysis is regularly carried out following the issuance of a rule to ascertain whether it is having the intended effect and whether it has had any unintended consequences. The top court’s judgement could perhaps nudge RBI to adopt similar practices, which could serve to demonstrate the mode, manner and basis of the exercise of its regulatory powers. It would also serve as a defence if and when its regulatory actions are challenged.Former US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Moving virtual currencies from the darkness of the ban towards the light of regulation is perhaps the appropriate action to mitigate the risks of volatility, anonymity, money laundering and financing of crime.The Supreme Court’s Wednesday judgement is an example of the country’s top court respecting RBI’s autonomy while fostering responsive regulation. This should not be mistaken as judicial activism, as it has reinforced the powers of the central bank and its unique role in the economy, while also encouraging it to exercise its powers with proportionality and responsibility, backed with adequate empirical evidence.L.

146,Enforcement Directorate files fresh money laundering case against Jet Airways and Naresh Goyal,"MUMBAI :The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday filed a fresh case against the grounded airline Jet Airways Ltd and its former Chairman Naresh Goyal, said an ED official. The case is under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) which is a criminal charge. The previous case was under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) a lenient charge as compared to charges of alleged money laundering.Goyal was questioned by the agency till late evening and then he was taken to his house for searches, said the official quoted earlier.This comes after the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) had ordered a fraud probe against the airline in July last year.According to MCA, Jet Airways was prima facie indulging into malpractices, mismanagement through siphoning/ writing-off/ diversion of funds and other financial irregularities, including but not limited to preferential/ related party transactions prejudicial to the public interest.This comes even as the lenders of Jet Airways are trying to recover their dues. The airline’s total liability, including unpaid salaries and vendor dues, is nearly  ₹15,000 crore. Jet Airways was grounded on 17 April 2019 due to severe cash crunch and for not servicing its debt obligations.The lenders to Jet led by State Bank of India (SBI) tried to resolve the insolvency at Jet Airways through bidding process. However the efforts failed on 17 June when the bankers started bankruptcy proceedings against the grounded airline and referred the airline to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).Recently, lenders of Jet Airways, extended the deadline for submission of bids for the airline to 9 March. The 270-day deadline for completing the insolvency process ends on 15 March. Subsequently, it may be referred for liquidation, unless the NCLT agrees to give an extension."
147,Opinion | The difference between hate speech and the dangerous kind,"It seems everyone is now an expert on hate speech. Most people tend to confuse hate speech with the speech they hate, rather than with speech that promotes hatred. And even justified criticism of politicians, ideas or traits gets described as “hate speech"". That obfuscates the term and prevents any meaningful discussion. Worse, it does not allow for a more important discussion about the distinction between hate speech and dangerous speech. The assembly elections in Delhi were unusually bitter, and the invectives that laced the speeches of two Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in particular, Anurag Thakur and Kapil Mishra, came in for special scrutiny, even from the high court. The speeches were not only misleading, but they were outrageous, insulting, malicious and spiteful, and revealed an appalling lack of civility. If the authorities were to interpret the laws literally, then there would have been a flurry of prosecutions under Sections 295A and 153A of the Indian Penal Code. The police would have arrested the offenders, regardless of their political status.But the Delhi Police was surprisingly lenient, showing an unusually touching commitment to free expression in this instance. Of course, this does not show any new-found warmth from the police towards free speech; authorities in India remain extremely vigilant in other cases, and when others have complained, they seem eager to charge or nab the BJP’s opponents accused of making speeches criticizing the government on social media, or shouting slogans that, in the authorities’ view, might have destabilized the Indian republic, because they appear to think that the republic is vulnerable and fragile. A despicable slogan urging people to shoot those deemed unpatriotic had reverberated at BJP rallies, and was even raised at a Metro station and during so-called peace marches since, but the police have been indulgent.Indian laws restricting speech that might disrupt harmony, offend sentiments or breach social order are fairly wide, but when the powerful have used such language, the prosecutors have been coy. Cases against politicians have rarely been filed; the procedures go on; witnesses turn hostile; and few, if any, get punished.Political discourse has been uncivil in India for long, and no leader is immune from grotesquely insulting epithets. But calling such rude language “hate speech"" is a matter of debate. The confusion around what constitutes hate speech could reduce significantly if we learn to distinguish between hate speech and dangerous speech. Dangerous speech may be defined as words that raise a significant risk that the audience will be encouraged and urged to unleash or condone violence on specific individuals or groups. Hate speech may be reprehensible, but need not be dangerous speech—which may be couched in euphemistic terms, but poses a clear and present danger of imminent violence. That’s why all democracies have laws against dangerous speech.Dangerous speech should have restrictions. But ill-informed, bigoted, shocking, absurd speech, which may be gratuitously insulting to communities, religions or individuals, needs to be tackled head-on with counter-speech, facts and denunciations. Banning it glorifies those vile words.American academic Susan Benesch, who runs the Dangerous Speech Project, offers a useful framework to distinguish hate speech from dangerous speech. Her questions: (i) Is the speaker able to influence a large following? (ii) Is the audience susceptible? Would the audience get swayed by the rhetoric, or does it have access to alternative, accurate information? (iii) Does the language dehumanize a group? Radio Mille Colliens in Rwanda continuously called Tutsis cockroaches and incited violence; genocide followed. The controversial British commentator Katie Hopkins called migrants “vermin"", and the UN high commissioner for human rights criticized her. When alleged foreigners, who may simply lack proper documentation, are called “termites"", such language would fall under just such a category. (iv) Does the audience believe it has a real—or imaginary —grievance? Think of the Serb leader Slobodan Milošević telling nationalists, “no one will beat you"", and invoking mythical wounds while commemorating the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo in 1989, presaging the collapse of the former Yugoslavia. (v) Does the speech talk of ethnic purity, describing opponents as outsiders polluting civilization? (vi) Is the language coded, like a dog-whistle, invoking subliminal imagery that resonates with the target audience even though the reference may be lost on others?Hate speech may be morally condemnable, but it need not be criminal. It can offend, it can cause hurt and pain, and it should be combated and delegitimized through facts and counter-speech. Mohandas Gandhi knew how to do it; Karwan-e-Mohabbat is trying the same in India at the moment.Confronting dangerous speech is more challenging because prominent politicians often indulge in it. If the state fails to act, it need not be because it can’t tell dangerous speech apart from hate speech, but perhaps because it knows where power resides.Salil Tripathi is a writer based in New York.

148,"Coronavirus cases spike to 29, containment plan afoot","NEW DELHI :The number of Covid-19 cases in India shot up to 29 after a clutch of Italian tourists in Jaipur tested positive, while health authorities on Wednesday reported a burgeoning trail after contact-tracing two previously identified patients. The number of confirmed cases surged after the government announced that a person in Gurugram has tested positive for the virus. The total includes three people from Kerala, who tested positive last month but have made a complete recovery.Tests on a group of 21 tourists in Jaipur threw up positive results for 14 Italians and an Indian. Two from the group had already tested positive in New Delhi.Six people tested positive in Agra after they were visited by a relative, a man previously identified as a 45-year-old from Delhi, who was found to be infected after visiting Italy.Another Indian had tested positive in Telangana on Tuesday. Authorities are trying to trace all those who came into contact with the 25-year-old patient, who came from Dubai to Bengaluru before catching a bus to his hometown HyderabadFour-step strategy Only a day ago, the total number of cases stood at six.Panic gripped the national capital region (NCR) after a 45-year-old man on Tuesday was found to have been infected by the virus, forcing the school where his child is studying to announce a temporary shutdown.The principal said on Wednesday that the school has received confirmation from the chief medical officer and district magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar that “all the children and family members"" of the patient have tested negative. “They are all under home quarantine for the next 14 days,"" the principal added.However, two schools in the vicinity have also closed and postponed exams.Health minster Harsh Vardhan held a group of ministers’ meeting on Wednesday and also met officials of the Delhi government, senior representatives of government hospitals in Delhi and state health minister Satyendra Jain.Harsh Vardhan advised states to identify isolation facilities to accommodate confirmed or suspected cases in every district, as well as logistical requirements, while also enhancing community awareness. “The need of this hour is to put a more strategic approach like cluster containment strategy, making the district collectors more accountable, contact tracing and strengthening state and district surveillance teams to avoid widespread community transmission and also breaking the chain of transmission, if found,"" said Harsh Vardhan.He said all passengers arriving into the country will have to go through medical screening from now on.At least 78 countries have been affected by Covid-19. The government has cautioned people to avoid non-essential travel to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan and other affected countries.Harsh Vardhan said the government may try to evacuate Indians stranded in Iran’s capital, Teheran, where 2,336 people have been infected and 77 have died from the disease. There are at least 300 Indians in the Iranian capital, mostly students and pilgrims. “The Iranian government has not yet given permission for it. An estimated 1,200 Indians, mostly students and pilgrims, are in Iran. If the Iranian government lends support, a testing facility could be set up there as well,"" he said.“We are also sending our scientists from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and three more from the Indian Council of Medical Research to Iran to check the feasibility of setting up a laboratory there for conducting coronavirus test,"" he added.Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters after a cabinet meeting that over 600,000 people have been screened for Covid-19 at 21 airports. The government is proactively engaged in dealing with the outbreak, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi monitoring the situation daily, he said.“While only the virology institute based in Pune was fit for conducting tests for coronavirus, the government has now set up 15 more labs and is in the process of establishing 19 additional centres,"" Javadekar said."
149,"Hang in there and believe that it can be done, and you will find solutions: Arundhati Bhattacharya","Arundhati Bhattacharya has been part of the Indian corporate sector for over 40 years, and has seen the landscape evolve for women making their way up in their careers. In a conversation with Mint, the former chairperson of SBI addressed the need for women to be aware of their strengths, and work on the constraints that keep them from achieving their true potential. You have seen the workplace evolve over the last 40 years. How have things changed for women employees?The number of women in industry has definitely gone up and this has led to changes in the ground-level matters. I remember when I joined the bank there were three restrooms in the branch, one for executives, one for men and one for women. As a woman executive, you were unsure of which one to use. These things, while simple, did matter a lot and they have changed with time.Another change I have noticed over time is that women are better represented on committees and in board rooms. Earlier, we saw more women in back-office roles. I believe that the women themselves were responsible for this to a certain extent, but there were a lot of issues when women tried to do line assignments that take you out of the branches to difficult areas. There are issues related to travel and accommodation that women face in such areas.Some things have changed. There is definitely quite a bit of movement in the younger lot. You see fewer couples who believe that the woman’s place is at home. These changes need to become universal for women to establish their space in the workplace.How important is the role of organizations in focusing on diversity and bringing women to the forefront?Earlier if there were two equally competent people of different genders, the male would be an automatic choice. Today, many organizations would prefer the woman instead. But what happens if the two candidates are not equally competent—will they cut the woman some slack? I think in some places where there is emphasis on diversity this can happen. I would like to think that women are getting ahead on account of being capable rather than merely because of their gender.However, if women are 50% of the population and there is only 4% representation of them in the top management of companies, then there is a need for affirmative action. The fact remains, that we have not been able to retain the same number of women who join the workforce as we go up the ladder. This indicates that there is leakage along the line, and there is a need for some positive action to remove the barriers that prevent the rise of women through the ranks.When assessing a woman employee, very often biases creep in. For example, some people may believe that a woman will prioritize her family over her professional commitments and therefore will not be able to perform at par with a male employee. This may or may not be true, or may be equally true for both genders. Similarly, there is a view that women are poor risk-takers. Affirmative action allows you to overcome these prejudices. Having said that, affirmative action cannot be forever. It should end when things become stable and that support is not necessary for women anymore.What are the strengths that women bring to an organization?The ability to multitask is the first and foremost strength that women bring to the table. Another attribute that is very important for leadership is the ability to be a good listener. Women are attuned to listening, and as a result, they have learnt to decipher not only what is being said in words, but also the tone, body language and what someone really means when they say something. Picking up on such non-verbal cues can be an important skill for a leader.The third thing is, women are more focused. They know they have responsibilities that extend beyond the office and they are focused on finishing their work as efficiently as possible so that they have the time to attend to their other duties. Women are not very territorial, and that can be a very big strength as well. When you are territorial, you tend to become isolated. Otherwise, there can be far greater collaboration in the workplace, and that yields better outcomes than doing everything on your own.What are the constraints that hold women back from achieving their potential at the workplace?Women do not network much, and this I attribute to their lack of time because they have other responsibilities. There are several channels of communication in an organization and the informal channels are just as important and effective as the formal ones. But if you are not clued in to that, it can be an issue.The other issue that women deal with is that they have trouble prioritizing. That is something they have to train themselves to do very early on in their career.Many women nurture a lot of self-doubt and the reason for that is the feeling of guilt about not giving enough time to their family. They need to tone down what they expect from themselves in each of the roles. If they do that, much of the self-doubt can be addressed and they won’t feel that they are short-changing either role.You are the role model for a lot of women who are building their careers. What advice would you like to give them?One piece of advice I give young women is, don’t give up. Giving up is very easy and it can be done in five minutes. Instead, hang in there and believe that it can be done, and you will find solutions.The second thing is that you should understand that you do need support, and be ready to ask for help, whether it is at work or at home.Be ready to help others as well. A kind word or genuine concern for other people will translate into them being there for you when you need support.As you go through life, you will need this support. It is not going to be possible to manage everything on your own. There is so much that women can do and we should not limit ourselves. Life is a challenge, lets face it!"
150,Lenders approve resolution plan for RCom,"NEW DELHI :The committee of creditors to Reliance Communications Ltd on Wednesday approved the resolution plans submitted by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and UV Asset Reconstruction Company (UVARC) for the now-defunct telecom operator’s businesses, two bank officials said, requesting anonymity. While Jio offered around  ₹4,700 crore to buy the tower and fibre assets of Reliance Infratel Ltd, UVARC offered  ₹14,000 crore for RCom’s real estate assets and telecom spectrum, as well as its enterprise and data centre businesses, which are part of RCom and Reliance Telecom Ltd, they said.Jio and UVARC have committed to pay 30% of the total amount within 90 days. “In addition, the lenders will clawback the priority payments of around  ₹4,300 crore made to Chinese and Indian lenders,"" the first bank official said, adding that while  ₹3,000 crore will be clawed back from Indian lenders, the rest will come from Chinese banks.The clawback provision allows a liquidator to seek a recovery, or claw back, of payments made to a creditor by the company, or make the transaction void.However, despite the clawback provisions, loans of Chinese lenders will reduce by nearly 65% from about  ₹12,000 crore to around  ₹4,000 crore, the first person added.RCom’s 38 lenders will recover  ₹23,000 crore, which is more than 70% of the  ₹33,000 crore in outstanding secured debt. Lenders had submitted claims for  ₹49,000 crore, including unsecured debt, in August.“This will be the highest-ever recovery of dues by financial creditors in the telecom sector, which has seen the exit or shutting down of 11 out of 12 telcos since 2012,"" the second bank official said.Emailed queries to Reliance Jio did not elicit any response while UVARC could not be reached for comment.RCom was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal last May after the CoC rejected an offer by Reliance Jio.Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."
151,Ruckus in Parliament over clashes in Delhi,"NEW DELHI :The Union government on Wednesday said a discussion will be held on 11-12 March on last week’s violence that rocked north-east Delhi, resulting in the death of more than 40 people. This was, however, rejected by the Opposition parties, which said it should start immediately. The development comes after two days of disruptions and sloganeering in both Houses of Parliament over demands for Union home minister Amit Shah’s resignation for failing to prevent the violence. The disruptions in proceedings continued in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for the third consecutive day on Wednesday.“We are ready for a discussion in the Lok Sabha on 11 March and in the Rajya Sabha on 12 March,"" parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said in the Lower House.The disruptions in Parliament on Tuesday had prompted Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to call for a meeting of chiefs of all political parties and ensure discipline in the Lok Sabha. However, Birla has so far not been able to convince the MPs.The problem was aggravated on Monday when MPs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress were involved in a scuffle in Lok Sabha, because of which the House had to be adjourned immediately for the day. “We insist that the government discuss the Delhi violence in the House,"" said Rahul Gandhi, former chief of Congress and a Lok Sabha member.Opposition MPs, including those of the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Left, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party rejected the offer to hold a discussion on communal violence in the national capital after Holi.“I will hold discussions with the Leader of the House and Leader of the Opposition on the time and under which rule should the debate take place after Holi,"" said vice-president of India and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu.PTI contributed to this story."
152,Women need to plan their finances to have a regular income in retirement,"Bengaluru-based Madhumati, who doesn’t use her second name, retired in April last year but has none of the financial challenges that women typically face. The 60-year-old doctor, who was with state-funded Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, is a specialist in blood cancer, and private hospitals are chasing her to work with them even after retirement. She also gets a pension from her government job. Being a doctor, she understands the healthcare-related expenses that she and her husband would need to bear in their senior years. But most working women’s profiles are far different from hers. Regular income can become a challenge for women during retirement, especially if they are widowed, given that a lot of them remain home-makers for all or most of their lives and even those with their own sources of income never bother to save for themselves separately. Women tend to live longer than men and, therefore, need a bigger retirement corpus. However, their saving potential is hampered by the fact that many women face a wage gap--employers typically pay lower salaries to women compared to men for the same profile. Women also tend to be more conservative investors and stay away from instruments that can give them higher returns over time.The generation that is close to retirement or has already retired had few investment options when they had started working. “For that generation, accumulating real estate was what systematic investment plan is for millennials,"" said Deepesh Raghaw, a Sebi-registered investment adviser based in Mumbai.As a result, the portfolios of those who have already retired or are close to retirement are mostly heavy on real estate. Take Madhumati’s case. Soon after her marriage, she and her husband decided to invest in real estate for all their significant financial goals. They built houses for their sons but managed their finances in a way that they didn’t have to take home loans. The elder son, Rahul, 31, is married and works as a product manager with a start-up. The younger one, Gautam, 26, is studying masters abroad. “Bengaluru was developing, and real estate turned out to be a good investment as the city expanded over the years,"" said Madhumati.A real estate-heavy portfolio can be a problem for those who need liquidity in the retirement years. Also, managing a property may not be easy for a senior. “If someone wants to leave the property as a legacy for the next generation, then it’s fine to retain it. Otherwise, it can become problematic when a senior cannot run around and maintain the property investments. It’s, therefore, advisable to move from real estate to liquid assets that are easily manageable,"" said Raghaw.Financial planners say that women are more meticulous than men and also have a balanced approach to investing. However, they are also conservative investors, primarily because of inadequate knowledge about equities. “Even if a woman is conservative, at least 25-30% of the portfolio should be in equities. Anything lower than this won’t be meaningful,"" said Raghaw.Madhumati tried her hands at equity investments around a decade back but liquidated them in three-four years; the returns were not even on a par with fixed deposit rates. But there was one mistake she made. Equity investments can be volatile in the short term and need to be held for a long period to help the retirement corpus grow in later years.Though she grew slightly comfortable investing in equity after meeting her financial planner three-four years ago, she has stopped investing in equity as she doesn’t want volatility in her retirement portfolio. “I have some equity for diversification,"" said Madhumati.Equity investment over the long term, seven years or more, would give better returns that can help to grow the post-retirement kitty. But getting into equity closer to retirement or after retirement can be difficult. It’s best to do it with the guidance of an expert. Increase your exposure gradually. If you want to keep 25% corpus in equities, start with 5% in the first year and increase slowly to the targeted allocation over the next few years. Stay away from illiquid assets such as real estate and invest in fewer assets for ease of management."
153,MP govt in crisis amid rebellion,"NEW DELHI :The Madhya Pradesh government under chief minister Kamal Nath is facing a survival crisis as at least 10 MLAs of the ruling Congress party and its alliance partners have rebelled against the state leadership. The Congress has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of trying to bribe the MLAs to switch sides. The ruling alliance has also dared the main Opposition party to demand a floor test if it is sure of its strength in the assembly.The key worry for the Congress is that it does not have a majority on its own and the state government is dependent on support of two MLAs of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and a lone legislator of the Samajwadi Party (SP).The Congress won 114 seats in the 230-member assembly and has the support of two BSP MLAs, one SP MLA, and four independent MLAs. The BJP had won 109 seats but, after a gap of 15 years, could not win a majority in the state.“The people involved in buying MLAs using black money are scared that their corrupt practices will be exposed by the Congress government in the state. There is no threat to the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and it will function for five years and complete its full term. If needed, conduct a floor test,"" said B.S. Rathore, a minister in the Madhya Pradesh government.The problem, which was brewing for a few days, took a dramatic turn on Tuesday evening when 10 MLAs of the Congress, BSP and SP reached Delhi and went to a hotel in Gurugram. Congress leaders have managed to convince six MLAs to return to the alliance. Senior party leaders are trying to convince the other four to also return.The timing of the rebellion in the Congress comes ahead of Rajya Sabha elections scheduled on 26 March where Madhya Pradesh has three vacant seats.“The issue is about the Congress and what is happening in the party but they only make baseless allegations against the BJP. There is a problem in the Congress and infighting is happening that is why Congress is facing this problem. The BJP is not involved in bribing MLAs. The party’s leadership does not carry out such activities but what can we do if the state government is facing internal rebellion,"" said Shivraj Singh Chouhan, former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and senior leader of the BJP."
154,"Why PVR, Inox Leisure shares are no longer blockbusters with investors","From being solid hits with investors, shares of multiplex companies, PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd, have lost their edge. Stocks of both companies have declined as much as 22-26% from their 52-week trading highs on the National Stock Exchange on 25 February. That’s just six trading days. Not without reason. Covid-19 cases have been detected in India and investors worry that if the virus spreads, footfalls in multiplexes will be adversely affected. Sure, the exact impact is difficult to gauge at the moment but there is uncertainty and we all know stock markets don’t like ambiguity.Of course, the sharp fall in PVR and Inox Leisure’s shares suggests that investors are taking into account a good share of the risks.According to Urmil Shah, research analyst at IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd, PVR shares trade at an EV/Ebitda of 9.8 times for FY22 based on Tuesday’s closing price. This is about 5% higher than the EV/Ebitda of 9.3 times seen at the time of F&B (food and beverage) issue in July-August 2018.Graphic by Santosh Sharma/Mint  Two years ago, valuations of multiplex firms had corrected when PILs were filed in states including Maharashtra to allow outside food and regulate F&B prices at multiplexes.EV stands for enterprise value. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Inox Leisure shares trade at EV/Ebitda of 7.6 times for FY22 based on Tuesday’s closing price. This about 15% higher than the EV/Ebitda of 6.4 times seen at the time of F&B issue in July-August 2018. According to Shah, these multiplex valuations imply about 24-25% discount to the median one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 13 times in the last five years. On Wednesday, PVR and Inox shares further fell by 2-4%.“We believe if the virus were to spread rapidly in India there is high probability that Q1FY21 will take a big hit in terms of Box Office, which eventually will impact FY21 performance as a whole, which is slated to grow 13% year-on-year in 9MFY21 based on Hindi content pipeline visibility as of now,"" said Karan Taurani, an analyst at Elara Capital Ltd.Meanwhile, both companies are adding new screens to their portfolio, which will eventually add to revenues in the long run. In the near term, investors would do well to keep expectations low, as the March quarter outlook too is not rosy, given the below-than-expected box-office collections.As such, the fear factor surrounding Covid-19 would drive sentiment for shares of multiplex firms. “In the worst case, the impact would be for short-term and not structural which the F&B issue could have been. However, the news flow on detection of further infections is likely to weight on valuation in the near term,"" said IDBI Capital’s Shah."
155,Re-skilling can open up whole new avenues after a sabbatical,"At 47, Supriya Sehgal’s career is still evolving. Supriya, who serves as the registrar of JK Business School, is in the process of completing her PhD, and still wants to go back to the corporate sector where she began her career at 23 after doing her MBA. But things don’t always go according to plan. Supriya got married soon after, and by 24, had her daughter Mansi. “I have always been a bit of a workaholic, so even after I had my child, I would head out for work in the morning and only return at 9pm or 10pm. I soon realized that at this rate, my daughter will not even know who I am, so I decided to take a break,"" she said. While Supriya had only planned to take a short sabbatical, but decided to extend her break so that she could dedicate more time to her daughter when she started schooling. In the meanwhile, she joined the coaching centre her husband ran, teaching commerce subjects and also took classes with MBA aspirants.  Word got around, and she was offered a position as visiting faculty at JK Business School. While she felt out of her depth initially, she decided to take the plunge. In 2015, she was offered a full-time engagement. Soon, she started taking on administrative responsibilities, which eventually led to her being offered the position of registrar. “My only resolve was never to say ‘no’ to anything,"" said Supriya.While she is happy with where her career break landed her, Supriya didn’t get a chance to plan for her sabbatical, and had to rely on her can-do attitude to fight her way back into the workforce, albeit in a different capacity. But for many women, not being prepared can mean a temporary sabbatical turning into a permanent one, as they fall off the radar. “A career break can impact a woman’s confidence. It not only means no income in that period, it also means a loss of economic value. Women often have to return at their last salary or a lower one,"" said Dipika Jaikishen, chief investment officer, Basis, a financial planning platform that caters exclusively to women.According to Jaikishen, the way to tackle this is to have a “sabbatical fund"" in place. “In the case of a planned sabbatical, it is ideal to build savings that see you through a part of that extended period,"" she said. Jaikishen recommends using the corpus to fund vocational courses and certification. Reskilling during a break, like Supriya did, is a great way to stay relevant and employable.Jaikishen added that for many women, the real challenge is the lack of their “own money"", especially after moving from a full-time career to a break. The loss of personal income is something that Supriya went through and was happy to overcome. “When I was helping at my husband’s coaching centre, I did earn, but it didn’t feel like it was my money. He invested on our behalf, and was very fair with his allocations, but something was missing. Now I receive my salary into my own account, and make my own investments,"" said Supriya, who dabbles in mutual funds to build a corpus for retirement, now that her daughter has completed her higher education. Whether you are looking to take a short break or a long one, being financially prepared for a sabbatical is the key to returning to the workforce successfully. It’s equally important to use time to upskill or reskill yourself and be flexible in terms of choices.For Supriya, while getting back on the corporate horse wasn’t possible, she took whatever opportunity came her way and now feels confident to resume her original career path. Also, as you prepare to come back to the workforce, remember to have some serious conversation with your family who will have to get used to the idea of not seeing you all day.Having enough of a corpus in place can tide you over the loss of income for that period, and also help you stay up to date, so that you don’t feel out of the loop when you do return."
156,"Firms opt for work from home, virtual meetings","MUMBAI/NEW DELHI :Companies are moving meetings and events online, banning domestic and international travel and encouraging employees to work from home in response to the spread of Covid-19 virus. After major international technology conferences were cancelled through this week, Google on Wednesday morning called off its biggest tech date, the I/O developer event, which was to take place in May in California. Google had also scrapped its Cloud Next event in San Francisco in April, in favour of a digital event.“Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities, we have decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event at Shoreline Amphitheatre,"" a Google spokesperson said.With more employees, educators and students working remotely in response to the outbreak, Google is helping them stay connected and productive.“We want to help businesses and schools impacted by Covid-19 stay connected: Starting this week, we’ll roll out free access to our advanced Hangouts Meet video-conferencing capabilities through July 1, 2020 to all G Suite customers globally,"" tweeted Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google. G Suite is a Google tool for cloud-based collaboration, among other things.Smartphone manufacturer Realme cancelled its physical launch in India this week, but said it would livestream an event. The 2020 Geneva Motor Show, too, cancelled the on-ground event, with BMW, Mercedes Benz, Daimler and Aston Martin announcing live broadcast of their press conferences.Harshvendra Soin, chief people officer, Tech Mahindra, said: “We have postponed all internal events, which required large gatherings and everyone has been advised to adequately leverage technologies like tele presence and video conferencing.""Mindtree Ltd is taking a “wait and watch"" approach, and is pushing many meetings virtual and delaying some of them, said managing director and CEO Debashis Chatterjee.Global software giant Microsoft has made its collaboration tool available for free for the next six months in a bid to support public health and safety.Bill Wagner, the chief executive officer of software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud-based remote connectivity services firm LogMeIn said this week: “Starting immediately, we will be offering our critical front-line service providers with free, organization-wide use of many LogMeIn products for three months through the availability of emergency remote work kits.

157,Young women in their first job should try to invest more,"For Meenal Solanki, 29, becoming independent and managing her own home didn’t happen till just two years ago. During her first working stint, the HR professional stayed with her parents and managed to save 60% of her salary. However, since many of her expenses were taken care of by her parents, she does not regard this as her first job in the sense of being financially independent. The savings, however, did not transition to investments, partly due to the sketchy knowledge she had about investing at the time. As far as investments went, for the longest time, Meenal took comfort in the fact that she had a Public Provident Fund account, which her parents had made her open. But it is only recently that the idea of investing her money had dawned on her. The turning point came when she moved cities and started her first job away from home. Her new employer began taking  ₹5,000 per month from her salary and putting it directly in a liquid mutual fund. “Once I was on my own, I realised I was hardly saving anything. Suddenly I had bills to pay, and I already had an education loan to pay off. So when I saw that my employer was investing money on my behalf, I got very interested in the idea of mutual funds as an investment,"" she said.The main financial goal she had in mind was retirement, and wanted to start saving early for it. The decision to invest was primarily driven by worries about old age, but it has worked to her advantage.“Young women who are single and just starting to work should try and invest more money for three reasons. First, they have a greater chance of taking a career break than their male counterparts, for having children. Second, because women are likely to live longer. And third, awareness about investments among women spreads to the whole family,"" said Nishith Baldevdas, a SEBI-registered investment advisor.Unlike Meenal, who decided to take matters into her own hands, typically young professionals delegate the job of money management to their parents. “Though this is not true of all women, some of them go from delegating financial decisions to their parents to delegating them to their husbands,"" said Baldevdas. This can be damaging, because it breeds both financial and psychological dependence among women.So if you are single and working, it’s important to nurture the habit of making your money work for you. “You should try to read books on the subject or watch educational videos. However, for those who don’t have enough time to do this or lack confidence about investing, approaching a financial advisor is the best option,"" said Baldevdas.Meenal still has a long way to go. She has not built an emergency fund yet. She also uses the same mutual fund SIPs for both short term goals like foreign holidays, and long term goals like retirement, instead of designating funds for specific goals.But what she has managed to do is make an effort to educate herself about personal finance. “I’m still not saving enough, but it’s a start,"" she said, adding that she is open to working with a financial advisor in the future.Baldevdas sounded a note of hope about young women managing their personal finances. “There is a stark difference between women of older generations and those who are in their 20s. Those from the younger generations are taking charge of their own finances and often start financial planning even before they get married. Overall, women are more patient with their money and invest more conservatively than men. They are also less easily swayed by market noise,"" he said."
158,Competition for Royal Enfield to weigh on Eicher Motors’ stock,"Eicher Motors Ltd’s stock has fallen 23% since 1 January, steeper than two-wheeler companies such as Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Bajaj Auto Ltd. Apart from negative investor sentiment due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the twin challenges of stiff competition in premium motorcycles and the slowdown in commercial vehicle (CV) sales continue to drag its stock. Indeed, Eicher Motors’ strategy to start BS-VI transition is beginning to show results. Sales of its cash cow and premium motorcycle maker Royal Enfield nudged 1% higher in February from a year ago. Most other two-wheeler makers recorded a double-digit sales drop. Better still, its inventory level of less than a week is relatively low compared to Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Co. Ltd, which are holding about two-four weeks of inventory.Further, Royal Enfield has been able to pass on rising costs from regulatory compliance to customers by way of new launches, along with price hikes. Meanwhile, FY20 exports so far have nearly doubled. This drove the stock up from the 52-week low of  ₹15,200 hit in August.Graphic by Santosh Sharma/Mint  However, it is prudent to bear in mind that Royal Enfield has a low base in sales as it underperformed the industry for four quarters from Q2 FY19 till Q1 FY20.Importantly, the road ahead is rocky, especially for premium bikes. “Competition is expected to increase over FY20-22, with new launches in the mid-size lifestyle segment from Jawa, Bajaj Triumph and Harley Davidson (in international markets),"" said a report by HDFC Securities Ltd.Further, Royal Enfield’s marketing and sales efforts to combat competition may bump up sales at the cost of profitability. Note that in Q3 FY20, the stand-alone operating margin, which reflects the motocycle segment’s performance, fell by a huge 430 basis points year-on-year.That apart, pain in CVs is still severe. So far in FY20, Eicher Motors’ CV sales are down 27% year-on-year. In any case, analysts forecast a sales growth in Royal Enfield only from the second half of FY21, as expected for most two-wheeler makers. FY20 is likely to end with a 14% year-on-year sales drop. Therefore, weak operating leverage and stiff competition will cap the increase in profit margins and stock prices."
159,Scare does not spook investors’ long-term bets on India ventures,"MUMBAI :Investors do not see the Covid-19 outbreak having any long-term impact on their bets on India, despite the virus forcing companies to take preventive measures in the work environment. The investors are, however, keeping a close watch on the situation to see how the next two quarters unfold.“Some of the best companies that you might want to invest in are now within a value range where they are attractive. As for our portfolio companies, we just have to ensure that we stand by them through this time. We’ll help them through the crisis. We see a long term demand slowdown of maximum two quarters due to this which is not a large impact,"" said Sandeep Naik, managing director and head, India and South-East Asia, General Atlantic.Anuj Ranjan, managing partner, Brookfield Asset Management and CEO for India and the Middle East, said his company invests in businesses for the long term. “We are an investor and we invest in businesses for the long term. Geopolitical events keep happening, but we look at businesses from a 10-year horizon.""The outbreak, from a private equity standpoint, will create interesting opportunities, Naik said on Wednesday at the Mint India Investment Summit that is being held in Mumbai.Organizations across the country said they are taking measures to contain the impact of the disease, even as India on Wednesday reported multiple cases of Covid-19 from various cities.Many employers are ensuring the workforce has access to hand sanitizers at entry and exit points, while others are discouraging physical meetings and providing N95 masks in offices, factories and distribution centres.Fast-moving consumer goods major Hindustan Unilever Ltd has put in place enhanced cleaning regimes and a protocol on when and what type of masks are needed to be used.Clix Capital, a fintech company, is sending out periodic advisories through email to all employees enlisting the precautions they must take against Covid-19. The advisory is also flashing on the television screens meant for internal communications.People are at risk of infection if an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes in their vicinity. As a result, a number of major industry events have been called off after companies withdrew participation citing employee health concerns, including events in India switching to web and broadcast options instead.With a few isolated cases reported here, organizations have turned their focus on employee safety with many restricting non-essential international and domestic travel, especially to China, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Italy and Iran.Global medical and travel security firm International SOS noted that many clients have started forming crisis management teams, providing assistance to employees, controlling and monitoring travel and performing simulation exercises to train employees.Bidya Sapam and Anirudh Laskar contributed to this story.romita.m@livemint.com"
160,It’s important to prepare yourself before having children,"Deepa Shenoy Rathod, 35, who works as the leader of the product team in an insurance company, always had the clarity that she won’t quit her job, whatever happens. So unlike many other women who end up taking a break from work when they have children, Deepa plans to join work after her maternity leave gets over. Deepa gave birth to twins in September 2019—Vivaan and Vaani—and is currently on her maternity leave. Like most other women, she was advised by her family to be prepared to choose between work and her children, but she is convinced. “I have put in a lot of time, effort and energy to reach the place where I am today. For me, my career was always as important as having a child,"" she said.Deepa is not only fiercely protective about her financial independence, but also wants to share the financial responsibilities of her household with her husband. “We had taken a home loan four years ago. If I had to quit the job, the entire responsibility would have rested on my husband. With two children, it will become more difficult to provide for all the expenses with a single income,"" said Deepa.Even in a double-income household, it’s important to prepare for future expenses after the birth of children. Deepa and her husband understood this quite clearly right from the start. “We prepared ourselves by starting mutual fund investments through systematic investment plans (SIPs) as soon as we decided to have children,"" she said.But Deepa is careful enough to not channelize all her savings towards her children’s future expenses. She invests in Public Provident Fund (PPF) as well but wants to keep that kitty for her retirement.Kartik Jhaveri, director, Transcend Consulting (India) Pvt. Ltd, a financial planning firm, advises women to invest separately for themselves in order to remain financially independent.“In order to remain financially independent, women should start saving aggressively for themselves as soon as they get a job, whether they are married or not, so that they can have financial independence after having children in case they need to quit their jobs or take a sabbatical,"" said Jhaveri. Even if they don’t take a sabbatical, it’s important for them to secure their future.Deepa is in a demanding job as she heads a team. However, what helped her plan her maternity leave and her comeback is clear communication with her organization. “I communicated with my office clearly about my plans to have children, this helped me as they were accommodative about the leaves and breaks I took from work. I also accumulated my leaves so that I could extend my maternity leave,"" she said. The company provides for six months of maternity leave, but Deepa is on leave till May.But not all women may have that option. Therefore, Jhaveri advises women to be ready to change their jobs or look for other options. “Women should be open to change their jobs and join an organization which provides flexibility. They can choose to work from home or opt for a part-time job as a consultant,"" he added.Deepa also thinks that with two incomes, the couple will be able to afford household help to take care of her children. “We would have needed help anyway, as it would have been difficult for me to manage two kids. With me continuing to work, it was easier for us to afford help,"" she said. Being financially independent lends you confidence and the way Deepa is handling her situation clearly shows that."
161,Marriage does not mean losing financial independence,"Before getting married, Mumbai-based Dhwani Mody, a marketing specialist, would take help from her father to make money decisions. The 25-year-old would easily invest up to 40% of her salary every month and continues to do so three months into her marriage. Though her saving rate remains the same, Mody acknowledges that marriage brings along a lot of changes in one’s life. “I’ve realized how difficult it is to manage both household expenditure and personal expenses. It’s taught me the importance of planning in advance,"" she said.Marriage, especially in India, is considered a huge milestone for women and brings with it a host of changes. From household chores to managing finances, responsibilities increase manifold, and you are expected to plan and prepare for two people instead of just yourself. Amid all this, it’s important to make sure you don’t lose your way by giving in to unilateral decisions made by your spouse, especially when it comes to money.For Mody, the transition has involved making an added effort in terms of decision-making. “Being part of a joint family requires me to be a little more considerate when it comes to decision-making because I have to think about everybody,"" said Mody. But the fact that the family is career-oriented has helped her maintain her financial independence.When it comes to managing money, it is more of a team effort for Mody and her husband. “My husband and I list the expenses at the start of the month and prioritize them based on urgency. We have some goals as a couple which we want to achieve together but we also have individual goals which we are looking to achieve individually,"" said Mody, who works with a global consultancy. If there’s something that’s changed for Mody after marriage, it is the fact that she has become more careful about her spending. Since the couple is building a house of their own, they’re trying to curb unwanted spends.As far as investments go, her husband has the upper hand. “Honestly, between my husband and I, he is savvier when it comes to investing. He plans all our investments, runs them past me and makes changes if there’s any disagreement,"" said Mody. The investments made as a couple are in joint names but Mody is also continuing her existing individual investments which she’d started before getting married. This helps her retain control over her money.As a result, Mody is able to strike the right balance and is not totally dependent on her husband. Priya Sunder, director and co-founder, PeakAlpha Investment, a financial planning firm, said she often sees women, who at one point used to independently manage their money, relinquish the responsibility to their spouse after marriage. “A marriage is a partnership in all ways. It’s not only about sharing your life; it is about sharing financial responsibilities as well,"" said Sunder. If the husband controls the financial decisions of the family, it can disrupt the balance of power in a marriage, increase dependency and break the woman’s confidence about being able to contribute to the family’s decisions, the financial planner added.Some women also tend to give up on their careers after getting married but it’s important to have a steady source of income of their own. “Life is uncertain and even strong marriages can crumble. If you are dependent on your spouse for your money needs, you may find yourself in a vulnerable position if he is no more or in case of a divorce,"" said Sunder. This could force you to look for a job at a later stage in life when employment opportunities for a stay-at-home woman may not be to your liking or lucrative enough.Since Mody and her husband were dating for six years before marriage, they are aware about each other’s investments quite well. Marriage also requires two people to understand each others’ habits and when it comes to money habits, Sunder said both spouses should give each other the space to spend a certain discretionary amount and discuss jointly if and when the spending threshold is crossed. Being too controlling does no good. Transparency has helped the Modys build a healthy relationship, both emotionally and financially.It’s also important to be prepared for a rainy day. “Women should get into the habit of logging into bank and investment accounts and determining how the money is being spent and invested. This way, in the case of an unfortunate event, they will have enough knowledge to make money decisions,"" said Sunder.If you’re someone who’s going to get married in a few months or are newly-wed, here are some things to keep in mind. One, ensure you are an active, knowledgeable and involved participant in all financial decisions of the family. Two, if you’re a working woman, make sure you’re saving and investing in your name. Three, contribute towards the household expenses and save in proportion to your income. Four, be mindful of the family’s liabilities and ensure you have adequate insurance cover. Five, ensure you have at least six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund.If you feel you need to work towards managing your money life better, read relevant books, attend seminars, tune into personal finance podcasts or engage with a financial planner."
162,"Disruption can lead to unforeseen opportunities, says Schwarzman","MUMBAI :The Covid-19 epidemic will impact asset valuations temporarily, but could offer more attractive opportunities to deploy capital than what most investors anticipate, Blackstone Group chairman, CEO and co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said. The virus has killed more than 3,000 people globally so far, while the number of positive cases in India has now shot up to 29.“In our business we call this a Black Swan event. It is completely unanticipated but here you are. The assets you own will go down in value temporarily, but the opportunity to deploy capital, I think, will be greater than what people suspect,"" Schwarzman, who is in India on a three-day visit, said in an interview on Wednesday.Schwarzman founded Blackstone in the 1980s with his partner Pete Peterson. Today, Blackstone manages investments of more than $500 billion across asset classes such as private equity, real estate, credit, and others. It is the world’s largest alternative asset manager by assets under management (AUM).“Around the world we are going to be seeing other types of disruption, which will force certain owners of assets to sell things or need capital, particularly in markets that have weak banking systems. So, I think there will be a variety of unanticipated opportunities for us that come as part of a global situation,"" he said.In the near term, the spread of Covid-19 is a bigger challenge for the global economy than trade wars and geopolitical tensions, Schwarzman said.“I am less concerned about trade tensions than some other things. The coronavirus really upended expectations for the current year. I think it will take down global gross domestic product,"" said Schwarzman.The pandemic will have a major impact on certain industries such as travel, across the whole chain, whether they are airlines, hotels or cruise ships, Schwarzman said. Companies that are present in certain markets such as China will feel the impact, he added. “There will be disruptions in supply chains, which will also decrease growth rates,"" Schwarzman said.This is another one of those periods where a lot of factors are determining the outcomes that were somewhat unanticipated, he said.However, Schwarzman said that given that there appears to be a roadmap for drug development for the virus, the spread of the disease could eventually have a limited impact.“All the experts say that it should be at least a year or a year and a quarter before a vaccine gets developed. So unlike some crisis that you don’t know how they are going to end, this one seems to have a roadmap with development of vaccines and there could be other medicines that could be useful in the short term,"" said Schwarzman.“So we are dealing, most probably, with a crisis of a limited dimension, other than the fact that once you start an economic decline then that has its own momentum,"" he said."
163,Opinion | What to do in the face of a setback,"At a recent session, Shalini, a senior working professional, shared about her divorce. After working for 19 years, she was back to square one, financially. During her married life, her accounts and investments were handled by her husband, who used most of the funds to buy property. After the divorce, she was left with no assets (as the husband’s name was primary in the property documents), a large home loan and the responsibility of supporting her 15-year-old son. Shalini was slowly working towards rebuilding her life. At another session for women entrepreneurs, I met two women who were part of family businesses. While they were fully involved in the business, they were not given a salary but a monthly allowance. Even though there was no dearth of money for their expenses, they were not involved in the family’s finances. If their parents gave them money, the husband would decide how it was to be used. One of the women, who was part of a well-known business family, had recently lost her husband and was at the mercy of her son for her expenses.Instances of domestic financial abuse like these are common across economic classes in India, where the husband and in-laws dictate how a woman’s income and streedhan are to be used. Widowed women too face many problems due to their lack of financial knowledge and are easy victims of fraud too.There is an urgent need for women to take charge of their finances and not wait for a setback to do so. If you have had a setback, here are some things you need to do right away:1. Understand what you own and owe. You will need to figure out a way to find out what your assets and liabilities are.2. Own your financial situation. Think back to what you did wrong and see how to rectify it. It could have been as simple as Shalini’s case of entrusting the entire earnings to her husband without questioning why investments were being made only in his name. Or it could be high lifestyle spending or negligible health insurance due to which, you are struggling to pay for medical expenses.3. Do not hand over money management to anybody, including relatives. They do not know your life goals or money mindset. Moreover, they may be tempted to use the funds themselves or invest where it suits them. There was a case where the relative invested in the fixed deposit of a particular bank and marked it as lien to a loan that he was taking.4. The first step is to create a budget and discuss it with dependant children. The children might have been used to a particular lifestyle and that will have to change with the changing financial situation. Stay away from loans.5. It is essential to take adequate term life and medical insurance. At least  ₹5-10 lakh of medical insurance with  ₹5 lakh of critical illness cover must be taken. In case of a divorce, try to have the children covered under their father’s insurance.6. Save and invest carefully for financial goals. Use goal-planning tools to find out the amount to be saved. You might have to tone down goals. The kids may want to study abroad but this may now be possible only with some scholarship.7. Stand your ground on what matters to you. If you are not comfortable doing so, don’t. In Shalini’s case, she refused many post- office Friday parties to be able to save more, without worrying about what people were going to say about her.8. Change nominees for various accounts and keep a track of financial documents.Over a period of time, while managing money, you will make mistakes but will also gain confidence. The key is to keep the resolve and remain committed. You can also help other women around you by sharing your experience. Hopefully, that will get more women to take charge of their finances.Mrin Agarwal is a financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pvt. Ltd and co-founder of Womantra"
164,A playbook to take your firm into the unicorn club,"A great idea is essential to starting a company that has potential to scale, but an idea alone isn’t always enough to take a startup out of a garage and into the league of large enterprises. Questions from first-time, and even serial, founders often revolve around the concepts of growth and scale. For the past 18 years, I’ve been working with high growth startups, and I believe there are nine determinants of scale. The odds of scaling and growing into a unicorn increase significantly if all these conditions are met. What really mattersTo start with, mega trend and market opportunity. At times, a mega trend may not be obvious or evident, and can be triggered by a smart entrepreneur who can visualize this. For others, the mega trend may only be visible in hindsight. Whether Amazon and Uber spotted a mega trend before it was visible or just happened to be the first to execute what were obvious mega trends is a debate worth having.When a mega trend and a large market come together, it attracts “gorillas"" or the large incumbents. Gorillas are, however, not always as successful as more nimble entrants, but often have sufficient heft and financial clout to cause these new entrants serious pain. Gorillas come in different forms, and one common manifestation is in the global player like Uber and Amazon. Ola and Bigbasket have proved to be strong competition to Uber and Amazon in the Indian market through a combination of great execution, strong founder ambition, and an alliance with other gorillas (SoftBank and Alibaba).Then comes what I call the two Fs of scaling: founder ambition and foundation. It was business thinker C.K. Prahalad who said, “If your aspirations are not greater than your resources, you’re not an entrepreneur."" Amazon started as an online bookstore and could have remained that but it went on to do many different things, including creating a cloud services platform in the form of AWS. Swiggy is another example of founder imagination and ambition. Ambition and imagination can manifest in different forms—for some is it about hustle, for others, getting the right organization architecture.Despite the lack of a strong foundation, a startup could scale for a short period of time, but this usually is not sustainable. Almost every startup funded by Rocket Internet in India falls into this category, including Jabong and Food Panda. Rapid scaling without a good product-market fit is a case of riding on a weak foundation.The third aspect to scaling is strategic choices and strategic execution. Most startups that scaled made right strategic choices at key points in their journey. They handled the inflection points and pivots well, and made the right decisions when it came to mergers and acquisitions. Making the right strategic choices is a combination of clear thinking, courage to forego short-term benefits in favour of long-term sustainability, and doing the right things for the right reasons.Beyond the big strategic choices, teams need to make the right choices every day in the context of execution. Problem-solving skills and an ability to collaborate help make the right choices every day. It is about getting a bunch of seemingly ordinary and interrelated pieces to dovetail perfectly that for an outsider it would not even look like innovation. Strategic execution is also about knowing what not to do. It is about prioritization and focus.Capital countsCulture, customer centricity and human capital are the other determinants of scaling. Customer centricity starts by asking, “Why does a customer buy our product or service?"", at every stage. It is being able to design the product or service based on continuous feedback. Bigbasket’s decision to go in for an asset heavy (or a full-stack) model was based on thoughtfully answering the question “why does a customer shop with Bigbasket"".This playbook for scale is at best a broad set of guidelines. When ambition is backed by knowledge of the enablers of scale, and an idea of how to make these determinants work for you rather than against you, the odds of scaling are multiplied.T.N.

165,What apps have to do with pet care,"Each time Mumbai-based Amit Verma, 36, got online to look up pet care products and grooming and other services for Spock, his Cocker Spaniel, he was flooded with information that left him lost. Frustrated, Verma decided to take matters into his own hands and joined the pet care industry. “There was just too much to read and so many products available. I was always confused about what I should eventually buy. That’s when I thought what was actually needed was a one-stop shop for pet services that assured a pet parent of the right stuff,"" says Verma, who runs a marketing agency.By mid-2018, Verma launched an app, DoggieTheApp, which offered several services for dogs from vet listings to food and boarding and walker options. “There was nothing like that at that point and I was certain that it would help pet parents like me.""The latest addition to the growing pet industry are startups that offer apps for pet care services. TailsLife is one of them. Like Verma, Balaji Ramesh, 34, too realized the amount of information available on pet care was overwhelming and decided to launch TailsLife in 2015 to cut through the clutter. “I started out by writing articles, but through the app, we provided customized content for pets based on their age and other details. The market was pretty good and I had some savings as well, so I took the plunge,"" he says.With an initial investment of  ₹10 lakh, Ramesh launched the app and started providing services in Bengaluru. By 2016, they had received a round of funding, which helped them roll out their own pet food line. “When we started out, we focussed a lot on the number of downloads that we were getting, which climbed to 30,000 at one point. But we soon realised we needed to monetize the app to keep the business sustainable when the investments dried up. That’s how we got into manufacturing natural dog food, which is our primary source of revenue today,"" Ramesh says.PetPals, too, started out with an app two years ago and gradually added services like food, walkers and vets, besides assistance when it comes to adoption and rescues for dogs and cats.While there have always been several websites providing similar services, Verma believes an app is critical since the entire experience is personalized.DoggieTheApp registers 800 to 1,000 downloads each month. Verma banks on his in-house techies for any changes on the app, besides a sales team that drives revenues. They take a margin on all services that work on a peer-to-peer model and currently have 2,500 active customers across Mumbai.“On our app, you can organize everything from deworming schedules to medical and vaccination records. We even provide e-consultation by vets. The way the platform is built, you should be able to use it for the smallest requirement of the pet; a website would have been too cumbersome for something like this,"" Verma says.The Pet Club looks at millennials who are driving the petcare startup space.rite to us at businessoflife@livemint.com"

167,Biden’s Super Tuesday surge reboots Democratic race,"Democrats have waited three years for a winner to call their own and take on President Donald Trump. On Super Tuesday, Joe Biden laid his claim to becoming their champion. He won across the Deep South, showing his appeal with black voters at the heart of the party, and claimed victory in Minnesota, a predominantly white Rust Belt state in Trump’s cross-hairs this November.He won the rich, highly educated suburbanites in Virginia and North Carolina who waffled for months over which candidate to support. He also scored an upset in Massachusetts, the home state of one rival and in the backyard of another.And late in the night, Biden laid claim to another upset, this time in Texas—the second-biggest delegate trove -- and remained ahead in Maine, states that seemed hopelessly out of reach just days ago.In politics, you have to win to win. And in the crucial Super Tuesday primaries in 14 US states, Biden did just that, and Democratic voters singularly obsessed with defeating Trump finally began coalescing around their candidate.There’s still a long road ahead for the former vice president. His chief rival, Bernie Sanders, won California—the biggest prize of the entire nominating race—where a runaway victory could give the Vermont senator enough delegates to blunt Biden’s gains on Tuesday. And the former vice president’s turnaround was made all the more remarkable because of his plunge from front-runner status, bruised and battered by a meandering campaign, lacklustre fundraising and trademark gaffes.Still, the whirlwind three days following Biden’s convincing win in South Carolina—which propelled top rivals like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar back the former vice-president —underscored the extent to which Democrats were ready to unite behind anyone perceived as ready to take on Trump.“Just a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead,"" Biden told supporters in Los Angeles. “I’m here to report, we are very much alive.""The eagerness for an alternative to Sanders grew acute after the Vermont senator failed to leverage what only days ago seemed like his race to lose. He had done little to address concerns that have always plagued his campaign: that his democratic socialist platform faced a ceiling of support, and that his take-no-prisoners style of campaigning repelled the moderates he would need to claim the nomination and successfully take on Trump.No candidate may capture a full majority of delegates before July’s convention in Milwaukee, and there will undoubtedly be good nights for Sanders, perhaps as soon as the next round of primaries on March 10. Four of the six states voting then were captured by the Vermont senator in 2016. Biden will need to step up his fundraising and increase his discipline on the campaign trail, and Sanders will be poised to seize on any missteps by his newly energized rival.But the calendar includes the so-called Acela primaries on April 28 on Biden’s home turf, and more races across Southern states that Hillary Clinton leveraged to her party’s nomination. Tuesday’s performance puts Biden in position to capture a plurality of votes, and his ties to the Democratic superdelegates who might ultimately decide the contest run decades long.And the Sanders campaign’s insistence that the party should unite behind the nominee with a delegate plurality—made loudly and insistently before Biden’s late surge—would complicate any effort to cause mischief at the convention.Speaking in Vermont late Tuesday, Sanders remained defiant, saying he could tell supporters “with absolute confidence we are going to win the Democratic nomination.""If Tuesday offered a clear winner, it also provided two obvious losers.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who had hoped a blitz of ad spending would disrupt the primary calendar, instead saw half a billion dollars vaporized by Biden’s momentum. Bloomberg won only one contest—America Samoa, which he claimed with 175 votes—and was projected to end the evening far behind the benchmarks offered by his campaign just days ago.*****************************Bloomberg suspends presidential campaignColumbus: Michael Bloomberg suspended his presidential campaign Wednesday after failing to persuade Democratic voters he was the best choice to defeat President Donald Trump despite record spending that topped a half-billion dollars, Axios reported.Bloomberg had staked his candidacy on gaining a critical mass of delegates on Super Tuesday and subsequent races, after taking the never-before-tried path of skipping the first four contests. But he decided to drop out after he failed to collect enough delegates to continue being a serious contender."
168,Opinion | The current state of cooperative federalism in India,"Amid the growing rhetoric of strengthening cooperative federalism in India, it is useful to pause from time to time and review the actual progress. The ongoing budget season is the right time to carry out a realistic assessment. After the Union budget for 2020-21 was presented on 1 February, at least four state governments have released their budgets: Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. While the first two states are governed by regional parties, Rajasthan is governed by the Congress, and Uttar Pradesh is ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is also in power at the Centre. Unfortunately, despite being a functional democracy for more than seven decades, India cannot ignore the role of the parties in power while reviewing the dynamics between various pillars of governance. A dispassionate analysis that focuses merely on requirements and performance is unlikely to reveal the full picture.In her budget speech, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the need for greater Centre-state cooperation to implement agricultural reforms, strengthen medical education, promote tourism, and attract investments.Almost all state budgets cover these issues. In fact, the Odisha government follows a practice of presenting its budget in two parts, with the first part dedicated to agriculture and allied activities. To promote tourism, the Rajasthan government has proposed implementing a policy on the Ease of Travelling. The Uttar Pradesh government is in the process of establishing 21 new medical colleges and a medical university. The Tamil Nadu government is likely to launch a new industrial policy shortly that will provide incentives compatible with the goods and services tax regime to attract investors.This may suggest a rosy picture. However, there is much more to this than meets the eye. Under the Union budget, the total estimated transfers to states from the Centre for the ongoing fiscal year have been reduced by around  ₹1.41 trillion. This is because of a decrease in the estimated transfers to states on account of their share in central taxes and centrally-sponsored schemes.These reductions have not gone unnoticed by states. The Congress-run Rajasthan government, in its budget, has blamed the Centre for economic mismanagement and the consequent reduction of the state’s share in central taxes by more than  ₹10,000 crore. It argues that while the Centre has several options of raising funds, such as disinvestment and approaching the Reserve Bank of India, no such option is available to the state.The Tamil Nadu budget also points out that the Centre has reduced the state’s share in central taxes for the current fiscal year by around  ₹8,000 crore. While terming this as unprecedented, it notes that the state government has been able to partially make up for the shortfall by obtaining additional grants from the Centre of around  ₹5,000 crore. Given that Tamil Nadu is governed by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), a strong regional party and a partner of the BJP at the Centre, unlike Rajasthan, it might have been able to negotiate a better deal for itself with the Union government in New Delhi.The government of Odisha, in its budget, has also noted that its share in central taxes for the current fiscal year has been reduced by  ₹9,000 crore. Still, it has proposed a fund of  ₹500 crore to facilitate timely payment of wages under the rural employment guarantee scheme, pending receipt of central assistance. Similarly, it has allocated  ₹400 crore for railways, though that is a central subject. Given that the state is governed by the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which perhaps wants to maintain a safe distance from the BJP and not rely on its favours, it appears that the state government is not keen on negotiating with the Centre for higher funds, unlike Tamil Nadu.The most interesting story emerges from Uttar Pradesh. The state has been forced to revise its estimated receipts on account of its share in central taxes downwards by a massive  ₹17,000 crore. Unlike other states, this substantial reduction did not find mention in its budget speech, and was quietly slipped into one of the budget documents. This is perhaps indicative of the constraints that the state government has to work with, being governed by the BJP.Despite the transfers to states during the current fiscal year being revised to  ₹11.87 trillion under the Union budget, such transfers are estimated to increase by more than  ₹2 trillion to  ₹13.90 trillion in the next fiscal year, which is perhaps unrealistic. Unfortunately, states have accordingly projected a substantial increase in funds to be received from the Centre and have planned their expenditure on that basis. These may need to be trimmed in the future.Politics has trumped economics and the greater good thus far in India’s story of cooperative federalism. This needs to be fixed before it is too late.Greater transparency and stakeholder participation in the budget-making process of the Centre as well as states could go a long way in this regard, as also institutionalized mechanisms for better Centre-state coordination. Above all, political parties need to rise above their electoral mindsets and act in favour of the country’s greater good for India to realize the true potential of cooperative federalism.Pradeep S.

169,Opinion | Understanding Bernie Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism,"When US Senator Bernie Sanders describes himself as a “democratic socialist"", he is arguably using those words in a different way than many other people. Once that becomes clear, more American voters should have reason to support him than currently do. The original meaning of socialism implied public ownership of the means of production, or, more colloquially, the nationalization of firms and corporations. Being a socialist by this definition would indeed be a mistake. For starters, the state is not an efficient manager. Moreover, in the long run, this model of socialism has been shown to lead to a society quite opposite to the one that state ownership was meant to achieve.The experience of the Soviet Union demonstrated why it is a mistake to centralize ownership in the hands of the state, with all the booty in one place. Sooner or later, control of it is bound to be captured by a few individuals—the nomenklatura during communism’s heyday, followed by oligarchs during its decay. In other words, the last stage of this kind of socialism is, ironically, crony capitalism.Listen carefully to Sanders, however, and it quickly becomes evident that he aspires to a very different “socialism""—namely, a variant of the Nordic model, refashioned for the 21st century. The Nordic countries are vastly more equitable than the US, and, contrary to popular opinion, their economies also allow for greater upward mobility. A poor person in Denmark, for example, has a much greater chance of moving up the income ladder than their counterpart in today’s US.Sanders has stressed this, and he has a long track record of activism on behalf of the poor and the marginalized. He seems genuinely inclusive, and has repeatedly stated his opposition to discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation, even though this is not always a popular stance. It is to his credit that he has not muffled this message in an attempt to gain popularity.Sanders makes it clear that this is who he is, and one must take him or leave him with this in mind. In the process, he has brought a rare moral voice to the political arena.Such an approach is needed, because the level of inequality in the world today is unacceptable. In the long run, it damages democracy, because the poor cannot have a voice when they are so completely marginalized. Sanders’s repeated attacks on inequality address this threat head-on. In fact, he is a social democrat, and thus closer to his fellow senator, Elizabeth Warren, one of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, than their rhetorical differences might suggest.The challenge facing the next US president will be formidable. Donald Trump’s tenure has damaged not only the US, but also, given the country’s global importance, the wider world. We now live in a polarized world where the plight of the worst off is more hopeless than it has been in a long time. In their hopelessness, these people often have ended up supporting the very leaders who care least about them.Creating a society that is vibrant, growth-oriented, democratic and equitable will not be easy, because, as Anand Giridharadas recently argued in The New York Times, the super-rich have a vested interest in the status quo. Reality is more granular than the words we have to describe it, which invites deliberate muddling of terms, such as labelling someone who favours reining in extreme inequality as a supporter of Soviet communism.Furthermore, globalization and robotics—or globotics, as Richard Baldwin and Rikard Forslid pithily put it—are changing the landscape of work and the distribution of wealth. We are in new territory and will need novel policies to navigate it. For example, standard policies such as antitrust laws are losing their efficacy as conventional wage-paying work shrinks, and earnings increasingly accrue to those who own capital and hold the patents to new machines and products.So, it is important to admit that we do not know quite what the right policies are. There will have to be many experiments with new policies, and whoever is America’s president will need to be prepared to modify these policies and change course when necessary. Given the circumstances, it is important that the president has the intention, as well as the intelligence and flexibility, to experiment and adjust. Several Democratic candidates have these critical qualities (the few Republicans that also do have been marginalized by Trump’s ascendancy), but Sanders stands out in this regard.I believe that Sanders’s goals for the US cannot all be met. If nothing else, fiscal constraints will make it impossible. But that need not be a serious problem if Sanders were to win in November and then learn as he goes along. And meeting even a subset of his objectives will represent a move in the right direction.Recently, some Democratic voters have turned away from Sanders, following reports that Russia is supporting him in the Democratic primary. Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is said, wants Trump to win and believes that he will if pitted against Sanders. But a little game theory suggests that Putin may himself have engineered the leak, because he knows that Sanders is the only candidate who can defeat Trump. By letting it be known that he is backing Sanders, Putin hopes to ensure that many Democrats will not support the Vermont senator. And that would be good news for Trump. ©2020/Project SyndicateKaushik Basu is professor of economics at Cornell University and non-resident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution"
170,The plan to privatize parts of the railways,"Some trains are still chugging along slowly, railways minister Piyush Goyal quipped recently, referring to the 1968 hit Bollywood song Rail Gaadi Rail Gaadi in order to show how the popular image of the Indian train has not changed all that much since the 1960s. At an event in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in January, where he made that remark while announcing a new premium train for pilgrims, Goyal also insisted that India’s vast railway network will not be privatized. But, he stressed, private sector support was needed to end the “era of slow-moving trains"".To some within the government, leaning on the private sector to improve India’s trains was an inevitability ever since the public-private partnership (PPP) push began in the mid-2000s (primarily in the road and power sector). The new plan: invite private firms to run 150 passenger trains on 100 routes.The private operators will be allowed to run train services using the common infrastructure of the railways—from tracks and signalling systems to depots and washing lines. According to a document jointly prepared by federal think tank NITI Aayog and the railways ministry, the government is looking at a “paradigm shift in passenger train operations"" to deliver “world-class service"" to commuters. The move, it says, will reduce transit time, introduce modern coaches and take care of the mad rush for reserved tickets.Private firms, meanwhile, will have the freedom to decide fares and stoppages, and also the basket of services on offer in these trains. They will be allowed to run these trains for a 35-year period in return for a share in the revenues they earn, apart from payments in the form of haulage charges for using public infrastructure.“Come 2022, there will be major changes,"" said Bibek Debroy, who chaired a government committee on restructuring of Indian Railways that submitted its report in 2015. “You’ll have private trains, you’ll have private stations, and the passenger will be willing to pay more if there are visible improvement in services.""According to Debroy, who also heads the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, competition in running trains can break the existing rigidity in the railway system. “All competition is good...it always does things that you are not aware of,"" he added.However, the details of this radical new plan to modernize the railways are still fairly sketchy. For instance, it remains unclear how the railways can expect a shift from air and roadways—modes of transport it is losing passengers and freight due to lower fares and greater convenience—by raising passenger fares in exchange for better services on the new private trains.Another thorny issue is how private trains will operate without an independent regulator. Is it possible for the railways to sit in judgement in case of a dispute with private firms, while also being a competitor operating trains on the same routes? It is also not clear how new private trains will be accommodated since the existing rail network is already choked and it remains to be seen whether the dedicated freight corridors can free up enough capacity.A list of queries sent to the railway ministry and officials in charge of public relations seeking a clarification on many of the sticky issues elicited no response. Replies to questions raised by members of Parliament too are clipped.The ministry has constituted a group of secretaries to “advise on the terms and conditions"" of the private trains project, the government said in a written reply on 5 February, adding, “The revenue likely from the project and the details and modalities in this regard have not been finalised.""The nascent idea already has its fair share of doubters though. E. Sreedharan, whose enviable track record with the Delhi Metro earned him the moniker “Metro Man"", does not share the enthusiasm of either Goyal or Debroy. “My own experience with Metro is that we expected many private parties to come forward enthusiastically. Ultimately, only three came and all of them are in serious trouble...legal battles are going on,"" said Sreedharan, referring to the Delhi Airport Express Line, the Mumbai Metro line 1, and the Hyderabad Metro.“Private parties may come, but they will run away after a few months due to large losses. There is little room to raise fares,"" he added, pointing to the fact that upper-class air-conditioned (AC) fares in trains are often already similar to prevailing airfares.The contoursIn April 1853, when the first steam-powered passenger train chugged out of Bori Bunder in Bombay, it evinced sharp reactions. People named it the fire chariot; those who got intimidated by the noise called it an iron demon. Yet, the 34-kilometre service which was started as a private enterprise, the Great Indian Peninsular Railways, was a runaway hit. The train carried about 22,000 passengers in the first two weeks. The hope now, 167 years later, is that a similar privately-run train can spur the same level of excitement and innovation.According to a project information memorandum prepared by the government in January, in FY19, reserved passengers accounted for 18% of all travellers in non-suburban trains (3.65 billion). That year, the railways failed to provide berths to a staggering 89 million wait-listed passengers.The capacity constraints—existing routes operating at full capacity—has led to trains steadily losing passenger traffic to other modes of transport, admits the railways. Between 2013 and 2018, reserved passenger traffic on Indian Railways grew at less than 5%, on average. This compares to a 13% growth in air traffic during the same period.“Hence, there is a critical requirement to introduce private operations...which will allow (for the) introduction of next-generation technology and provision of higher service quality,"" says the information memorandum.According to the railways, the time taken by a private train to complete a journey will be comparable to the fastest train on that route and will not exceed 160 km per hour. On the same origin-destination route when private trains leave, no other train run by Indian Railways will leave within 15 minutes of scheduled departure of a private train. Each private train will have a maximum of 16 coaches. While maintenance of rolling stock (coaches and locomotives) will be the responsibility of private firms, the safety audit will be done by the railways.But at least in principle, the idea of private trains is sound, said Vinayak Chatterjee, co-founder and chairman at Gurugram-based infrastructure services firm Feedback Infra Pvt. Ltd. “The content vs carriage principle in infrastructure economics says that carriage should be owned by the state (tracks and rail network), while content (trains) should be a freely tradable commodity... India had overcome the backlash when airports were privatized; when the telecom sector was opened up...it’s time now for the railways to change,"" he said.According to Chatterjee, when Britain privatized its railways, it offloaded assets including tracks and routes. That led to an underinvestment in infrastructure. India is following a different path by introducing private trains, which are modern in design and efficient in service, and meets a certain customer demand to get them back on the train.But there is a crucial caveat, warns Chatterjee. For the private train project to succeed, the government will have to bring in an independent regulator. “Not just for tariffs, (but because) there will be operational issues. Railways can become usurious in its calculation of charges. There are issues related to timing, operations and routes. Private trains have to be treated as one among equals. Without a regulator, a lot of friction is likely between the railways and private players...friction will lead to litigation. In India, that takes years. It will lead to a downturn in (the) mood and a failed public-private partnership,"" he added.The project information documents released by the government, however, do not speak of a regulator. What it does state is that the concession agreement will specify penalties for failure to meet performance standards for private firms, and for any lapse on the part of the railways.Room for premium trainsWhile it is early days to hazard a guess as to how the private train project will shape up, the launch of premium trains by Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp. Ltd (IRCTC) gives an early indication. The Tejas trains were widely hailed as independent India’s first “private"" trains, though the project was handed over to state-run IRCTC without any bidding.The premium Delhi-Lucknow Tejas Express, which launched in October last year, has seen an average occupancy of 65%. After five months in service, its USP remains that tickets on the train are available at a short notice—since it is priced at about  ₹1,900 for an AC chair car seat just a day ahead of travel, compared to the superfast Shatabdi Express fare of  ₹900 (both trains take similar time—six-and-a-half hours for the 500km commute).IRCTC has since launched two more trains—the Mumbai- Ahmedabad Tejas, which has seen an occupancy of 80-85%, and a special train for pilgrims. The listed public sector firm has robust expectations from the private train project.“As on date in India, there is no operator other than IRCTC (for trains not run by Indian Railways). So, we have to tie up with some manufacturer of rolling stock (coaches and locomotives) or some investor who can organize rolling stock for us,"" said Mahendra Pratap Mall, chairman and managing director of IRCTC, in an earnings call on 13 February.He added that the performance of Tejas trains has exceeded expectations. “Lucknow-Delhi Tejas is nearing break-even in the first quarter itself (against expectations it would take two years). So, we are highly encouraged with this and Ahmadabad-Mumbai is performing even better, occupancy wise,"" said Mall.According to G. Raghuram, director at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore and an expert in transport infrastructure, the Tejas experience shows that the time is ripe for private firms to tap the market. “Through this project, the railways will discover the true price-demand-service sweet spots...and all private trains need not be high-end—a pilgrim express for low-end customers can (also) work well. In the next phase, PPP can come into hard infrastructure.""Red flagsBut while some are clearly gung-ho about the opportunities that lie ahead, there are clearly innumerable red flags along the route too. Imagine a situation where two trains are delayed due to fog on the same route – one run by the railways and another by a private firm. It may not be an easy task to decide who gets priority. The experience of private freight trains has been telling in this respect.“Since railways are also running container trains, we receive the stepchild treatment,"" said a senior officer with a private freight operator, who did not want to be named. “They promised us a level-playing field but did not implement it. We have invested crores (of rupees) and have no option but to stay put. The railways won’t even guarantee the time my cargo train will take to reach its destination and this has affected our business.""When private firms and railways run trains on the same tracks, the question of “priority"" is unavoidable, concurs Sreedharan. “This will introduce corruption as private operators will try to bribe their way out of the problem.""And with Indian Railways expecting an investment of around  ₹22,500 crore from the project, the stakes may be high. That may bring up the age-old question that surfaces with most attempts at privatization in India: who reaps in the revenue, the government or the government official?At this stage, very few independent experts are convinced that any benefits would accrue to the revenue flow of the railways. “How will private trains make money for the railways when premium trains like Rajdhani are losing money?"" said Partha Mukhopadhyay, senior fellow at Delhi-based think tank Centre for Policy Research.The biggest and most unique challenge, however, will be “the railways will be a competitor and a (de facto) regulator of private trains,"" said a Delhi-based infrastructure consultant, requesting anonymity. “Sectors like aviation and telecom succeeded because the government was willing to withdraw from these areas. But is the government willing to withdraw from railways and by how much? Is it ready politically?"""
171,When two bosses share a home,"For the past few years, Abhishek Gupta, who runs a real estate analytics firm CRE Matrix in Mumbai, has been helping his wife Prachi get the marketing right to scale up her speciality food startup, Yellow Apron. “We’ve been working together a bit, but our businesses are completely separate, and we wouldn’t want it any other way."" Though both understand the challenges of starting up and scaling, they know they can’t ever work together as co-founders. “Our styles of working are very different. I am curt and clinical in business, and she’s more patient and not very aggressive,"" says Abhishek, 41. “We’d end up arguing about things if we worked together all day,"" he says, laughing.Starting and scaling a business brings many challenges, and for couples with children and other responsibilities, it’s more common for one partner to hold on to a job while the other takes the plunge. Then there are couples who choose to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams, drawing support and learning from each other, and make it work by balancing the personal and the professional, risks and all.Bengaluru resident Lizzie Chapman, co-founder of fintech startup ZestMoney, can’t imagine anything worse than pairing up with her husband Gautam Mago, co-founder and general partner of VC firm A91 Partners.“It just wouldn’t work,"" she says. Having individual businesses, however, has resulted mutual respect, understanding and empathy for each other’s work and what they are trying to achieve.“We don’t bicker over small things or household chores anymore as we have larger roles that we care about. You also don’t feel guilty about working too hard because both of us are aiming for something more. And finally, there are two sets of celebrations you get to have when things go well. You enjoy and appreciate the other person’s little wins because you know how hard it is,"" says Chapman.LENDING A HANDOn any given day, Bengaluru’s Anuradha and Devendra Agarwal have to split their time between their individual startups and their two children. While Anuradha, 34, is the founder of Multibhashi, a language learning platform, Devendra, 37, is the co-founder of co-working space Instaoffice Business Solutions, and founder of boutique investment bank Dexter Capital Advisors.Naturally, personal life gets hectic, especially with children as young as 7 and 5, but what makes the juggling worthwhile is satisfaction of working on something they each love. “We both enjoy our work a lot. So, having less personal time doesn’t frustrate us,"" says Anuradha.In Delhi, Chandrika and Nakul Pasricha, echo this sentiment.“We each run a startup and understand what the other is going through,"" says Chandrika, 45, founder of Flexing It, a marketplace for short-term, skilled consultants. Nakul, 46, is director and chief executive of PharmaSecure, which protects brands against counterfeiting. Since both their businesses are in the B2B space, they have a lot to talk about, which has made the relationship stronger, says Nakul.Even though Anuradha’s startup doesn’t share common ground with Devendra’s, they help each other with hiring, marketing and organizational structuring. “I network with founders, while he has the investor community. The synergy is amazing,"" Anuradha says.Likewise, the Pasrichas use each other as sounding boards. “We keep the discussion to the strategic level. I believe you should make suggestions and step back because it’s the other person’s business. Too much meddling will be counterproductive,"" Nakul says.DIVISION OF TIME Finding time together can be challenging though, and they make the best of what they get. When Chandrika founded her venture in 2014 (Nakul had started a decade earlier), they decided on a five-day week, but obviously, work spills into weekends. “We coordinate any work responsibilities on the weekend and plan meeting friends and family. We realize that this journey (of building a business) is a marathon in which downtime is important,"" Chandrika says. Both have taken offices close to home to reduce commute time.The Agarwals convert work trips into family vacations. For instance, when both were invited to the Startup India event in Goa, they took their children. “We selected sessions and attended individually. When we were invited to an event in Vietnam, we turned it into a vacation,"" says Anuradha.Although Lizzie and Gautam hardly get time with each other, they both share a love for reading and talk about books.“Be okay with the randomness and ambiguity. Don’t worry too much about planning,"" she suggests.MONEY TALKWith the uncertainty that running a startup brings, the couples say it’s important to sort out finances. Else, it can be detrimental to the relationship.“We both became entrepreneurs after long stints in the corporate world and so, had savings and the financial security to take the risk. In fact, we openly discussed our finances and then put our respective savings into the businesses. A big learning has been that everything takes longer—revenue, getting investors—so you need to continuously decide how much family money you will invest in your individual ventures based on future plans, especially retirement,"" says Chandrika.Nakul says it’s important for couples to define their risk appetite and figure out business and life goals. “Businesses will have ups and downs. There may be times when one is doing well and the other isn’t. It’s important to be sensitive to the other’s situation at that point in time."""

""A viable path to the nomination no longer exists,"" Bloomberg said in a statement, having failed to deliver convincing wins in his electoral debut on Super Tuesday despite lavish spending on campaign ads across the United States.Endorsing Biden, Bloomberg said: ""I will work to make him the next president of the United States.""His exit ended a novel electoral strategy, a vast experiment in political advertising, as Bloomberg, 78, skipped the four early-voting states and instead focused on the 14-state Super Tuesday contest.His only victory on Tuesday came in the US territory of American Samoa.Biden, 77, the former vice president, accomplished his Super Tuesday goal of muscling Bloomberg aside and consolidating support of moderates to turn the race into a one-on-one contest against the democratic socialist, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.Bloomberg was winning more than 15% of the vote, enough to pick up some delegates, in Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, Utah, California and Arkansas.Since entering the race on Nov. 24, Bloomberg spent more than $500 million of the fortune he built on his eponymous media company on an ad campaign that vaulted him into the top tier of the Democratic field.After blanketing the airwaves with promises that he could defeat the Republican Trump in the Nov. 3 election, his support among Democrats and independents in public opinion polls rose to around 15% from about 5% when he entered.He hired thousands of staff and mounted a vigorous national tour focused on the 14 states that voted on March 3.But Bloomberg was dogged along the way by criticism over his past support of policies seen as racially discriminatory, including stop-and-frisk policing, which ensnared a disproportionate number of African-Americans and Latinos, as well as past sexist remarks.WARREN STILL IN RACEHis Democratic rivals attacked him in his first presidential debate on Feb. 19 in Nevada. US Senator Elizabeth Warren lambasted him for making crude jokes about women and Sanders accused him of trying to buy the election.Outside his rallies - which were often smaller than those of his rivals - protesters regularly waved signs echoing Sanders' claim. Inside them, Bloomberg detractors and enthusiasts alike ate from tables stocked with free food.Bloomberg was assailed for his spending despite his pledge to use his personal fortune to support the eventual Democratic nominee, whoever it was. Bloomberg apologized for stop-and-frisk a few days before he announced his candidacy.When Bloomberg got into the race many months after other leading candidates, he said he was worried none of the other candidates could beat Trump.""Trump would eat 'em up,"" he told CBS's ""This Morning"" on Dec. 6. He increasingly pitched himself as the centrist alternative to Sanders. In the Feb. 19 debate, he described Sanders' policies as ""communism.""Bloomberg's political fortunes initially rose after Biden, who led in public opinion polls during much of 2019, performed poorly in the first three nomination contests: Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.Bloomberg did not compete in those races, nor in the fourth contest in South Carolina, saying his late entry made it impossible to assemble a competitive election staff in those states.Bloomberg heavily criticized Trump, and the two New York billionaires traded insults, with Trump mocking Bloomberg's short stature on Twitter, nicknaming him ""mini-Mike.""Bloomberg earned his estimated $60 billion fortune by founding Bloomberg News, a leading purveyor of financial information for Wall Street firms.After spending much of his life as a Democrat, he switched to the Republican party in 2001 to run for mayor of New York. He became an independent in 2007, and switched back to the Democratic Party in 2018.His past as a Republican also dogged him during his presidential run. Warren attacked Bloomberg at the Democrats' Feb. 25 debate for giving money in 2012 to support the election campaign of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican and a key ally of Trump."

The petition is filed by a non-profit organization known as Air Passengers Association of India and is “proactive and constructive in participating in the successive stages of civil aviation reforms in India.""The plea says that as per a statement issued by DGCA on 28 August 2019 that several “significant technical issues"" have been experienced in airbus A320 Neo aircraft fitted with PW1100G engines and DGCA had “clearly acknowledged the threat to passenger safety in so far as it asked airlines to log all cases of detection of odour or smoke in the cabin during operations, monitor and inspect engines in case of vibration.The plea has alleged that despite being aware of ""significant technical issues with Airbus A320 Neo"", neither the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MCA) nor the DGCA have taken any concrete steps to ground these aircraft. MCA and the DGCA have only issued notices extending the timelines for carrying out the repairs or engine modifications by the airlines concerned, it added.""It is submitted that respondent 1 (MCA) and 2 (DGCA) have repeatedly extended the timelines for modified versions of the Pratt and Whitney engines to be installed, instead of grounding the entire fleet of A320 Neo aircraft,"" The petition reads.The petitioner has alleged that despite the safety risks being widely reported and being acknowledged internationally, Centre and DGCA have failed to ground the entire fleet of the faulty Airbus A320neo despite repeated assurances of being aware and conscious of the situation.The petitioner has prayed for grounding of entire fleet of AirbusA320neo till modification of engine is not complete.It has also sought directions to the ministry and the aviation regulator to frame regulations to prevent situations of aircraft with faulty engines flying in the skies and for imposing sanctions on erring airlines."
175,"Railway contractors' body threatens strike, claims bills worth  ₹25,000 crore pending","GUWAHATI :Railway contractors' association IRIPA on Wednesday threatened to go on a nationwide tool-down strike on March 6, claiming that bills amounting to nearly  ₹25,000 crore are yet to be cleared by the national transporter. At a press conference here, IRIPA vice president Mahesh Kumar said the contractors will observe the token strike across the country and a further decision will be taken as the situation arises.Without payment, no construction work will continue in the railways, he said.Kumar said the Indian Railway Infrastructure Providers Association (IRIPA) has been urging the railways for a long time to resolve the issue of pending bills but no relief has been granted.He said that the IRIPA wrote to the Railway Board chairman on the issue on February 29, but the contractors were told that budget provisions have fully been utilised and no more funds exist.""The department is insisting us to carry on the work without releasing any further payments,"" he claimed.The bills raised by the members of the association are withheld citing non-availability of funds, IRIPA secretary Pawan Bharatiya alleged.""Small contractors who have undertaken contracts for repair and maintenance works are suffering due to non-payment of their outstanding bills,"" he said.""Due to such non-payment, the contractors will have no other option but to stop the day-to-day works that may compromise the safety of train operations...,"" Bharatiya said.If the association is compelled to go for the strike, its members who have contracts related to sanitary and laundry works, and involved in operations of revenue nature will join in and even those contractors who have been paid will show their solidarity by joining the strike, he claimed.The members of the IRIPA are engaged by subsidiaries of the Indian Railways and other related organisations for the execution of work contracts of capital nature, Kumar said.

""25 long-haul aircraft and 125 short- and medium-haul aircraft"" will no longer fly, a spokesman for the group also including carriers Eurowings, Austrian and Swiss told AFP.Shares in Lufthansa have plunged in recent days as the likely impact of the COVID-19 disease on the aviation sector in particular has become clearer.The stock was up slightly in afternoon trading in Frankfurt, adding 0.6 per cent to trade at 11.98 euros (USD 13.29) just after 3:30 pm (1430 GMT) but slightly underperforming the DAX blue-chip index.It remains around 27 per cent lower than at the start of the year.On Monday, Lufthansa said it would slash its flight plan by 25 per cent, especially on short- and medium-haul routes including to virus-hit areas of Italy but also within Germany.The group has suspended routes to other virus hotspots, including China and Iran, to late April.Lufthansa has also suspended new hires as part of its measures to cushion the business impact of the virus, which it said Monday was ""not yet possible to estimate"".The International Civil Aviation Organization has said that the virus outbreak could mean a USD 4-5 billion drop in worldwide airline revenue.

178,Netflix and Amazon seek passage to India for new growth,"SINGAPORE :Netflix and Amazon are battling a dizzying array of homegrown outfits, from Bollywood producers to broadcasters, for dominance of India's streaming market, a key target as growth in Western countries slows. As more Indians shift to viewing movies and shows online, industry revenues from streaming in the country are set to jump from $500 million in 2018 to as much as $5 billion in 2023, according to Boston Consulting Group.With many Western markets saturated and Asia's top economy China effectively closed off to foreign streamers, a nation of 1.3 billion where phone ownership is forecast to rocket makes for a tantalising prize.""India is super important, for both Netflix and Amazon,"" Tony Gunnarsson, a streaming analyst from consultancy Ovum, told AFP at the recent Asia TV Forum in Singapore.""Netflix... need to continue to generate new subscribers, and there is no better place than India."" But the US giants face tough competition in the vast, ethnically and religiously diverse country where the streaming scene is rapidly evolving.There are dozens of subscription streaming services in India, according to Ovum, and some domestic outfits have more experience in producing content tailored for local audiences and in the country's myriad languages.A major player is Hotstar -- originally a homegrown outfit which later became part of the Disney empire -- which has attracted an army of followers in part by streaming Indian Premier League cricket matches live.Other Indian rivals include ZEE5, run by major broadcaster Zee Entertainment, and ALTBalaji, the video-streaming service of Bollywood producers Balaji Telefilms.As well as offering their services direct to consumers, streamers are bundling their content with mobile phone services in a bid to broaden their reach.Netflix, the world's biggest subscription streaming service, has made expanding in India a priority and aims to attract 100 million subscribers in the country -- an ambitious goal given analysts estimate it will only reach about seven million this year.The company made a mark with its first Indian original ""Sacred Games"", a hugely popular series about a troubled police officer starring top Bollywood actors, and has a slate of new productions in the works.They plan to invest 30 billion rupees ($420 million) in Indian content in 2019 and 2020.""This is India's golden age of entertainment,"" Srishti Arya, Netflix India's director of international original film, told AFP.""There are so many opportunities in streaming, creators are not restricted by length, duration."" Fellow US titan Amazon also has a strong foothold in India with its Prime Video service and, like Netflix, typically appeals to wealthier urbanites who want to see Western as well as Indian content.It is planning to release around one Indian original production a month over the coming year, and is ramping up its production of shows in regional Indian languages.Netflix has been lagging behind Amazon in terms of subscriber numbers but looks set to move ahead from 2021, according to Ovum.Nevertheless both will likely struggle to catch up to Hotstar, which reached 300 million active monthly users last year, although the Indian streamer works on a different model, offering some content for free and other shows only to subscribers.To compete in a crowded market, the US titans are offering their services for less than in the West -- Netflix introduced a package for India priced at only 199 rupees ($2.80) a month, which allows consumers to watch only on a phone or tablet, and Amazon Prime is 999 rupees ($14) for a year.And the scene is about to get even more competitive with the launch of the Disney+ streaming service in India next month via Hotstar."
179,Freshworks India arm reports net profit of  ₹30 cr,"BENGALURU :Ahead of a possible initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S next year, the India arm of software-as-a-service (SaaS) unicorn Freshworks Inc. has reported net profit of  ₹30 crore on a standalone basis for the year ended 31 March, 2019. This is a 76% increase from  ₹17 crore net profit in 2017-18.For the 2018-19 fiscal, Freshworks Technologies Pvt Ltd clocked revenue of  ₹404.7 crore, 59% up from  ₹254 crore in the year-ago period, according to data accessed by business intelligence platform, Tofler.The company’s total expenses for the period was  ₹364 crore, up 61% from  ₹226 crore in the previous fiscal, on higher employee benefit expenses.Freshworks turned profitable in FY18. It is now the second unicorn (startups valued at a billion dollars) to report profits after ed-tech company, Byju's.In November, 2019, the Chennai- and California-based company raised $150 million in a series H funding round led by Sequoia Capital, CapitalG, and Accel, at a valuation of $3.5 billion. Over the past year, the company acquired two US-based firms - artificial intelligence (AI) startup AnsweriQ Inc, and customer success management software company, Natero, Inc. Freshworks has more than 2,700 employees across 13 offices around the world.Freshworks is also one of the growing number of successful SaaS companies in the country alongside firms such as Zoho, Druva, Clevertap and Kaleyra. Funding activity in SaaS has been on a high lately, and it recently crossed the $1 billion mark in 2019.Industry observers also point out that SaaS companies have a better path to profitability and market reach compared to tech firms in the consumer Internet segment. Hence SaaS brands are increasingly becoming attractive to several existing Internet venture capital firms.An e-mailed statement from Freshworks said: ""We are a global company headquartered in San Mateo, California (USA). With our subsidiaries in UK, Europe, India and Australia, we realise revenue from business operations across these regions. The financial information reported publicly via regulatory disclosures in a particular region does not accurately reflect the overall performance of the company.

180,Lok Sabha passes direct tax dispute resolution scheme,"NEW DELHI :The Lok Sabha on Wednesday cleared the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Bill, 2020 that offers a scheme to settle 483,000 direct tax related disputes giving relief on part of the amounts due as well as immunity from prosecution. Lok Sabha cleared the Bill amid uproar by the Opposition parties over the recent sectarian violence in Delhi. The Bill tabled in Parliament last month aims to resolve disputes with an outstanding direct tax arrears of Rs9.32 trillion, a part of which could come to the exchequer if the scheme is a success. It could also spare courts and tribunals of prolonged direct tax litigation.The scheme allows beneficiaries to pay the disputed tax arrears without interest and penalty if paid before 31 March and if paid in the first quarter of FY21, the amount due will go up by 10%. In case the tax dispute is over penalty, interest or fee, the settlement amount payable is 25% of the dues if paid before the end of March. If paid in the next quarter, the payable amount will go up to 30%.According to experts, taxpayers have limited time to make use of the scheme by March end and an extension to April end would be a welcome move. Samir Kanabar, tax partner at EY India said rules and frequently asked questions (FAQs) will have to be issued to clarify operational as well as administrative aspects of the scheme.Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey had earlier said that suggestions received from industry will be considered for inclusion in a set of guidelines to make the scheme a success. The suggestions received includes a demand for inclusion in the scheme of disputes where assessment orders have been made but appeals have not yet been filed."
181,"Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime ban under fire as UAE extends virus curbs","An order to shut schools to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the Middle East’s premier business and travel hub has reignited a debate about an existing ban on free voice calls over the internet that complicates remote learning and working from home. All public and private schools and higher education institutions will close in the United Arab Emirates from March 8 for a month as officials attempt to curb infections, which currently stand at 27 in the country.A pilot program for distance education will be implemented during the period of closure, the Education Ministry said, without giving full details. Nurseries have been closed since March 1, leaving working parents grappling to find childcare at short notice.The Gulf state, where 85% of the population are foreigners, blocks calls using applications such as Microsoft Corp.’s Skype, Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and Apple’s FaceTime. The banned video services are encrypted, making them difficult for security services to track. But the curbs have long been a grievance for expatriates who want to keep in touch with family and friends back home and work more flexibly.“I highly recommend that the U.A.E. now re-visits its ban on VOIP video calls in light of the spread of coronavirus. If we want people not to meet in person let them conduct their business online,"" Emirati columnist Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi wrote on Twitter to his 490,000 followers on Wednesday. Global companies such as Twitter and JPMorgan are encouraging staff to log on from home.One third of Gulf companies are planning work from home to combat the virus threat, online recruitment portal GulfTalent said in a survey of 1,600 executives in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council released on Wednesday. And in a further sign of the outbreak’s impact on regional business, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad said it had asked cabin crew to bring forward leave amid passenger cancellations.The U.A.E.’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, which governs and oversees the sector, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Using the banned video-calling services -- part of virtual business life elsewhere in the world -- is possible in the U.A.E. through a virtual private network. But this is a cyber-crime which can lead to a fine of between 500,000 ($136,000) and 2 million dirhams, jail time, or both, a 2019 report by the U.S.-based watchdog Freedom House said.The encrypted services provide competition to the two main domestic telecommunications providers. Government-sanctioned applications are available for a subscription of around 50 dirhams a month. A free application, ToTok, was available in the U.A.E. but removed from Google Play and Apple’s App stores after allegations it was a secret spying tool for the U.A.E. It reappeared in January and the company has said users should ignore a warning message on Google Play and install it anyway.It’s not the first time the U.A.E. ban has come under fire. Billionaire U.A.E. businessman Khalaf Al Habtoor, founder of the Al Habtoor Group conglomerate, reiterated a call last year for the restrictions to be lifted in a video he posted on Twitter.In a 2019 report, Oxford Business Group wrote that residents and businesses in Dubai would likely continue to press for change. It cited the example of Microsoft which has held talks with authorities over unblocking Skype, and pointed out that neighbor Saudi Arabia scrapped its ban on internet calling applications in September 2017.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

183,"Govt asks Airtel, Vodafone Idea, others to pay balance AGR dues without delays: Report","NEW DELHI :The department of telecommunications (DoT) on Wednesday ordered Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and other telecom operators to immediately clear all dues to the government arising from the Supreme Court’s October order. “You are directed to provide the details of the payment made as required by above mentioned DoT letter dated 20.01.2020, and also pay balance amount without any further delay,"" DoT said in a letter to telcos, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint. The 3 March letter does not specify how much more operators need to pay.The latest DoT diktat comes even as the government discusses measures to alleviate the stress in the industry following a court order directing telecom companies to pay licence fee and spectrum usage dues totalling  ₹1.4 trillion.Airtel has so far paid  ₹18,004 crore to DoT, while Vodafone has deposited  ₹3,500 crore. Airtel claimed it has cleared all its dues to DoT and has the supporting documents to prove it, although the department pegs its total dues from the company at  ₹35,586 crore.But the latest DoT letter is likely to put Vodafone Idea in a difficult situation as the company has only been able to clear a fraction of its dues and lacks the ability to immediately clear all its dues. Vodafone Idea, which owes DoT an estimated  ₹50,000 crore in dues, is banking on the government to offer some relief in terms of easier payment terms and waiver of interest and penalty on dues.Vodafone Group Plc chief executive officer Nick Read plans to visit India on 6 March and has requested a meeting with telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to discuss the crisis, Mint reported on 3 March.Vodafone Idea, formed by merging Vodafone India with Idea Cellular of Aditya Birla Group, has been on the brink of collapse following the unfavourable court verdict. Controlling shareholders Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group, have ruled out further equity infusions into the struggling telecom operator.In its judgement, the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), on which it calculates levies on telcos. The order dealt a blow to the telecom industry, which argued that AGR should only include revenue from core telecom operations and not rental or dividend income. Telcos now have to pay dues for the past 14 years.The latest DoT letter indicates lack of coordination among the various arms of the government. Officials in the finance ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office have been brainstorming on steps to pull the industry out of its morass. “Several proposals are being discussed to provide the sector with immediate relief from the AGR dues,"" a person aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

It called these instances a ""major breakthrough"".In the case of the oil firm, the CBDT said that Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) default of about  ₹3,200 crore was detected.""The defaults included short deduction of tax and non-deduction of tax, respectively. Short deduction of tax pertained to TDS under section 194J (of the I-T Act) for several years on payment of fee for technical services for installation and maintenance of high-tech oil refineries, payments for chemical process of re-gasification and transportation of LNG,"" it said.""Default of non-deduction was detected on composite contracts involving service and purchase of products on which TDS at the rate of 2 per cent should have been deducted, but which was not deducted resulting in the said default,"" the CBDT said in a statement.In the case of the telecom firm, the TDS default amounts to  ₹324 crore.""The company did not make the required TDS of 10 per cent under section 194J of the I-T Act on technical contracts worth  ₹4,000 crore. The amount is further liable to go up once the enquiry is completed,"" it said.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which frames policy for the tax department, did not name the entities involved.In a similar action, the department found several hospitals in Delhi were ""openly flouting"" norms of TDS and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) and were paying less tax to the department.""During survey at two premier hospitals, one with more than 2,500 bed capacity and another with 700 beds, it was found that the former was not making any TDS on construction contracts as statutorily required while the latter was deducting tax at the rate of 10 per cent only on salary paid to doctors, instead of the present TDS rate of 30 per cent applicable for salary payments,"" the CBDT said.It added that enquiries made during the survey revealed that the terms of appointment between the hospital and the doctors indicated an employer-employee relationship on which the hospital was required to deduct tax at 30 per cent instead of 10 per cent as was being made by the hospital.""TDS defaults of  ₹70 crore and  ₹20 crore, respectively were detected in the said hospitals,"" the statement said.Further probe found that the hospitals were also ""not making"" the required TDS at 10% from the maintenance charges paid for the hi-tech sophisticated operation theatre and diagnostic equipments.It had also been seen that many hospitals were still not complying with the TCS norms that came into effect from June 1, 2016 under which, on any cash payment received in excess of  ₹2 lakh, the hospital was required to collect TCS at the rate of 1 per cent and deposit it to the government account.The department detected similar irregularity or TDS default in the case of a real estate group of Delhi against which it conducted a survey early this week.""Verification and analysis indicated outstanding TDS liability and interest payable of  ₹214 crore,"" it said.The CBDT said the department has stepped up enforcement action against TDS default cases as this category of revenue contributes to more than 45% of the total direct tax collection in the country.As per the rules, it said TDS has to be paid to the credit of the central government within seven days from the end of the month in which the deduction is made."

188,Lodha Developers markets bond that’s key to dodging default,"MUMBAI :India’s top builder is marketing a complex debt offering that it needs to complete successfully to avoid a default. The new bond from Lodha Developers International Ltd. will be key for it to refinance its existing $324 million note maturing 13 March. The company also needs to meet conditions involving setting aside cash before it can tap the proceeds of the bond.“We feel very good about the level of interest and commitments we have so far,"" said Abhishek Lodha, chief executive officer of Macrotech Developers Ltd., which is the flagship company of the Lodha group. He was referring to the group’s ability to close the bond sale in a difficult market that faces the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.Even before the virus contagion, Indian real estate developers had been grappling with slowing demand as the country’s economic growth slumps to a decade low and a lingering credit crisis constrains spending. At least  ₹10.5 trillion ($143 billion) of debt is vulnerable to default over the next three years, according to India Ratings, a local unit of Fitch.Lodha may fend off its near-term debt maturity, but refinancing risks remain high, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Selling the new note is key because Macrotech has no alternate financing arrangements, and if the new issue were derailed or if Lodha were to fail to meet the conditions, it would likely slip into a default, Moody’s said. Some of those conditions were unmet as of Feb. 28, it said.The proposed new note is “subject to significant execution and market risk, creating uncertainty around Macrotech’s ability to complete the bond transaction as planned,"" said Sweta Patodia, an analyst at Moody’s.Under the proposed bond terms, Lodha needs to set aside $118 million in cash before it can sell the new bond. It still needed to find about $32 million as of Feb. 28, according to Moody’s calculations.Lodha says the deal’s structure should reassure investors. “The comfort is that we will put the money first and then the new bondholders will put their money,"" said Abhishek Lodha. “That’s as strong a comfort as one can give.""Lodha’s 12% notes maturing next week were indicated at a discount of about 10% of face value on Wednesday, according to two Hong Kong-based traders, who asked not to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.Moody’s rates Lodha’s proposed bond Caa1, seven steps below investment grade, with a negative outlook. It cited the market risk, and uncertainty about Macrotech’s refinancing plans over the next 12 months in the face of about $1 billion in debt maturing through March 2021.Abhishek Lodha said the group has a strong track record in paying down its debt, citing positive cash flows over the last two quarters, which helped it pay back $355 million at Macrotech over the period.Lodha group is the country’s largest residential real estate developer with sales of about 119 billion rupees in the twelve months ended March last year, according to a Grohe Hurun report."

The Ministry of Home Affairs was tasked to work closely with state governments, including relevant district administration officials, to ensure compliance with screening protocols at Integrated Check Posts (ICPs).The meeting took note of confusion among the people over lack of proper knowledge of the virus. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is entrusted with disseminating information to the general public in a timely manner, including relevant advisories and 'dos and don'ts'.""The Ministry of Health briefed the meeting on the positive impact of a 24-hour medical helpline, operational across the country since January 23 with ten dedicated telephone lines. These facilities have received over 6,000 phone calls,"" said a government release.Participation of communities and local bodies were also stressed in the meeting to combat the public health challenge posed by the virus.Earlier on Monday, PM Modi tweeted: ""Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

190,Should you buy a Coronavirus-specific health insurance policy?,"NEW DELHI :More and more people are testing positive for COVID-19 (popularly known as Coronavirus) globally. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) report, as many as 1,792 new cases were reported outside China on Tuesday alone. In India, the total number of confirmed cases was at 28 as on Tuesday. Taking cue from the increasing panic and rapid spread of the virus, insurers have started offering specific products for Coronavirus alone. Digit Insurance, under the Inusrance Regulatory and Development Authority’s Sandbox regulations, has launched a defined-benefit health insurance policy for Coronavirus. Policyholder gets the full sum insured on being tested positive for the illness after which the policy terminates.The premium for the policy starts at Rs. 299 (including taxes) for a sum insured of Rs. 25,000. You have the option to increase your sum insured up to Rs. 2,00,000 and the premium will be calculated accordingly. For example, for a 50,000 sum insured, you will pay a premium of about Rs. 599.“One restriction which comes with a regular health insurance policy is that it requires 24 hours hospitalization for you to be able to file a claim. Some policies do include out-patient (OPD) expenses but most products which include OPD expenses don’t have many takers because the premium is relatively higher,"" said Vivek Chaturvedi, head of marketing and direct (online) sales, Digit Insurance. Within 24 hours of its launch, Chaturvedi said the company has sold over 200 policies.WHAT THE POLICY COVERSThe policy is valid for one year and the cover will be exhausted after the payment of 100% sum insured. Anyone below the age of 75 can avail the product which comes with a 15 days waiting period. The product comes with a defined benefit which means if you’ve been tested positive for coronavirus and file a claim, you’d be eligible for 100% of the sum insured. In case you’re quarantined which could lead to loss of income, you will be eligible for 50% of the sum insured.However, note that the policy comes with a host of terms and conditions. In order to be eligible for the claim, the insured should not have been in contact with anyone with suspected history of COVID- 19 till the end of the policy tenure. Also, the insured or their immediate family members should not have travelled to countries such as China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, Italy, Iran, Behrain, Kuwait, Taiwan since 1December 2019. Policyholders suffering from symptoms such as cough with or without sputum, cold or nasal block, fever with pody pain and shortness of breath for the last six weeks will also not be eligible.“The product has many exclusions making the plan very specific. Consequentially, it may not be a product that everyone will look forward to buying,"" said Rakesh Goyal, director, Probus Insurance, an Insurtech broking companyIf you travel abroad after buying the policy and end up contracting the virus, you will be covered only if you’ve traveled to any country other than China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, Italy, Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Taiwan, said Chaturvedi.SHOULD YOU GO FOR IT?Note that this is a disease-specific plan and comes with a list of exclusions which could make it difficult for you to file a claim. If you already have a standard health insurance plan, it makes little sense to go for this. “As of now, all health and general insurance companies are ready to support the insured in case of any claims filed for Coronavirus under their health plan,"" said Goyal.You could consider this product if you don’t have a health insurance policy in place and are worried about contracting the virus. However, Mint recommends going for a standard health plan first as it would cover you for hospitalization under any condition. Many health policies now also cover for pre and post-hospitalisation expenses.Shwta Jain, founder and CEO, Investography, a financial planning firm agrees. ""There are just too many exclusions and for a disease that's easy to contract (Coronavirus), the policy has gaps which will leave very few people eligible for the cover. One must ensure she has a standard health cover in place before going for a disease-specific policy."""

192,"Coca Cola India steps up regionalisation efforts, launches Bengali packaging for West Bengal","NEW DELHI :Local arm of American beverage maker Coca Cola said it is stepping up efforts to launch regional campaigns and localized packaging for its portfolio of beverage brands starting with the state of West Bengal. The move comes on the back of growing trend of localization among consumer goods companies that are mapping state specific shopping habits and rolling out products and campaigns suited to those. Consumers in the state of West Bengal will now be able to buy bottles Coca Cola and Minute Maid which will be labeled in the native Bengali language. The beverage maker has picked the state of West Bengal to run trials of what it called its ""hyper-localisation"" strategy as seeks to reach more consumers in India.“West Bengal is the first Indian state where the entire portfolio and marketing initiatives of Coca Cola’s brands have been hyper-localized to resonate with local language ie Bengali and suit consumer preferences,"" Coca Cola India said in an announcement on Wednesday.The maker of Sprite, Thums Up, Fanta, and Maaza drinks said it will extend this move with product and marketing localisation in other states after it scales up the reach of such packaging in the eastern state that is among its top seven markets in India, T. Krishnakumar, president, Coca Cola India and South West Asia, told reporters in Kolkata on Wednesday.“Local languages help us better connect with consumers in the region,"" Krishnakumar said.For starters, Coca Cola has rolled out packaging labels in Bengali for beverages such as Coke, Sprite, Thums Up, Maaza, Fanta, Limca, Kinley and Minute Maid. Each brand will devise a hyperlocal campaign to deepen connect and bring on-ground experience alive for consumers in Bengal, the company said. ""Coca Cola India’s hyper-local strategy will reflect in the marketing mix, packaging, advertising, social media activations and a range of on-ground events across portfolio,"" said Shehnaz Gill, senior vice president, operations, Coca Cola India.Going forward, the company could look at leveraging Hindi as the next big language, albeit once its trial pilot in West Bengal sees success and gains scale.The company also announced its partnership with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), as the team's official beverage partner ahead of the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).In the past, the beverage maker has used regional celebrities to endorse its popular brands in the language dominant in the state. For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, Mahesh Babu endorses Thums Up in Telegu. But the latest move will cover the company’s entire product portfolio and not just key brands with the entire communication and marketing in Bengali.In 2017, Coca Cola decided to use hyper-localisation as one of its key levers for growth in Asia’s third-largest economy where per capita beverage consumption is still low. Part of its plans include launching more local products such as the recently launched black grape-based sparkling beverage that is widely consumed in the state of Tamil Nadu."

208,"Ban on social media removed in J-K, Mobile internet speed still restricted to 2G, order effective till Mar 17","JAMMU :Removing a ban on social media platforms, Jammu and Kashmir administration on Wednesday allowed access to all web sites on 2G mobile data services and fixed line internet in the Union Territory till March 17. Earlier, only access to white-listed sites was allowed as the service was restored for a week on January 25 and subsequently extended from time to time, after being snapped on August 5 last year when the Centre abrogated the special status to the erstwhile state and bifurcated it into two union territories.The fresh order was issued by Principal Secretary, Home, Shaleen Kabra after assessment of the impact of telecom services regulation on the overall security situation and maintenance of public order and reports of law enforcement agencies.The order said the internet speed on mobile data service will be restricted to 2G only and the post paid SIM card holders would continue to be provided access to the internet.However, Kabra said the services would not be made available on pre-paid SIM cards unless verified as per the norms applicable for postpaid connections.As the period of extension of services was set to expire on Wednesday, the Home Department ordered that 2G mobile data service and fixed line internet connectivity with certain restrictions will now continue till March 17, unless modified earlier.About fixed line internet connectivity, the Principal Secretary said the Internet connectivity would continue to be made available with Mac Binding.Mac Binding essentially means to enforce a client machine to work from a particular Internet Protocol address.""It is further directed that the access/communication facilities provided by the government Viz e-terminals/internet kiosks apart from special arrangements for tourists, students, traders etc shall continue,"" Kabra said in the order.He asked the Inspector Generals of Police, Kashmir and Jammu divisions, to ensure communication of these directions to service providers forthwith and also ensure implementation of the directions with immediate effect.While continuing the ban on social media, authorities had last month said that anti-national elements and people across the border continue to ""misuse"" these networking sites allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private networks (VPNs).Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were asked to ensure access to 1,674 white-listed sites only and not to any social media applications.The restrictions on mobile and internet services were partially eased after the Supreme Court said in January that access to the Internet is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution and asked the government to review the curbs"

210,Opinion | Food companies are watchful of adding nutrition,"After launching edible oils in different varieties (rice bran, soya, groundnut, cottonseed) as well as introducing rice, atta, besan and sooji, the  ₹22,000 crore Adani Wilmer, which sells packaged foods under the Fortune brand, aims to add more nutrition to its staples. Its deputy chief executive officer Angshu Mallick talks of the opportunities he sees in the value-added commodities segment to attract the millennial consumers to its brand. Although the company is yet to take a call, Mallick said it could look at launching atta that doesn’t spike the sugar levels, brown rice and other fortified products. Recently, the Ahmedabad-based firm found a place in the India Spotlight Nutrition Index 2020, prepared by Access to Nutrition Initiative, a not-for-profit which ranks food and beverage firms based on their policies, practices and disclosures related to nutrition. In its second edition, Adani Wilmer ranked 11.The report, released last week, did not find the kind of coverage that the subject deserves considering that India is known for malnutrition on the one hand and obesity on the other. The idea behind the report is to drive positive change in the food and beverage industry in terms of diet and health. To that end, it acts as an accountability tool for the private sector companies and reviews their efforts in tackling the health challenge.In the Nutrition Index 2020, Hindustan Unilever and Nestlé India shared the number one spot, followed by PepsiCo India. Other companies that found place in the report for their efforts include Britannia Industries, Coca-Cola India and Mondelēz India. The report observed that while firms in India have shown increased commitment to providing healthy food, they need to do more to meet the twin challenge of micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight and obesity.Companies found to be fortifying their products according to standards set by food regulator Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) include Mother Dairy and Britannia. Others have joined FSSAI’s initiative to support the Eat Right Movement and pledged to reformulate their products. FSSAI launched the Eat Right Movement to improve public health and combat lifestyle diseases. On the demand side, the Eat Right Movement focuses on empowering citizens to make the right food choices. On the supply side, it nudges food businesses to reformulate their products, provide better nutritional information to consumers and make investments in healthy food as responsible food firms.In the Nutrition Index 2020, Hindustan Unilever , Nestlé India and PepsiCo India stand out for their reformulation targets with the intent to reduce salt/sodium, saturated fat and added sugar/calories. According to Nestlé India, its strength lies in its overall nutrition governance and its pledge to reduce fat, salt and sugar in its products. The company believes that nutrition is a fundamental need and the food industry has a vital role to play in enabling healthier lives.V.S. Kannan Sitaram, venture partner at Fireside Ventures that has invested in several food startups, believes that packaged food can be nutritious. Companies are voluntarily offering value-added products and the consumer is also demanding these resulting in the many better-for-you variants being launched, he said. Sitaram added that fortifying food does not make it expensive. “Some additives such as vitamins and iron do not cost much. Others like protein do. The other important consideration is whether these nutrients survive the cooking process, do not alter taste, and are bio available,"" he said.Chocolate maker Mondelēz India is also a signatory to FSSAI’s Eat Right Movement with commitment towards evaluating its portfolio and reformulating the products to reduce fat, sugar and salt. That is not all. the company also restricts marketing to children under 12 years. It has disclosures on the front of the pack of energy per serve per pack and has created single-serve portions of 200 calories or less that makes up 95% of its chocolate portfolio. Its other efforts include the introduction of micronutrient- fortified and less sugar products such as Bournvita for women, which contains no added sugar.Clearly, as Indian consumers move towards good-for-you products, which come with healthy ingredients such as fruit and nuts or fortified with proteins, vitamins and minerals, companies including the multinationals, home-grown fast-moving consumer goods makers and startups in the food space are voluntarily offering nutrient-rich foods and snacking options.Shuchi Bansal is Mint’s media, marketing and advertising editor. Ordinary Post will look at pressing issues related to all three. Or just fun stuff."
211,Coronavirus update: Saudis ban Umrah pilgrimage in Mecca over virus fears,"TEHRAN,		             IRAN :Saudi Arabia has banned citizens and residents from performing the Muslim pilgrimage in Mecca over fears about new virus. The announcement came on the state-run Saudi Press Agency on Wednesday, quoting an unnamed Interior Ministry official announcing the ban.It gave no time frame for how long the suspension will stand.Last week, Saudi Arabia closed off the holiest sites in Islam to foreign pilgrims over the coronavirus. That disrupted travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affecting plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage.Friday prayers in Iran have been canceled across all provincial capitals amid the country's growing coronavirus outbreak, state television said.Friday is the main congregational day of prayer in Islam, and traditionally an important event for Iran's clerical rulers.The report Wednesday comes as Tehran and other areas canceled Friday prayers last week over the outbreak.Iran earlier announced that the new coronavirus has killed 92 people amid 2,922 confirmed cases across the Islamic Republic, the highest death toll in the world outside of China.Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour announced the new figures at a news conference in Tehran, raising Iran's death toll from the new illness to higher than Italy's, where there has also been a serious spike in infections.There are now over 3,140 cases of the new virus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.The virus has sickened top leaders inside Iran's civilian government and Shiite theocracy. Iran stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 90,000 people and caused over 3,100 deaths.Experts worry Iran may be underreporting the number of cases it has.“The virus has no wings to fly,"" Jahanpour said. “We are the ones who transfer it to each other.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile acknowledged that the virus was in nearly all of Iran's 31 provinces while speaking at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday.“This disease is a widespread one,"" he said, according to a transcript. “It encompasses almost all of our provinces and is, in a sense, a global disease that many countries in the world have become infected with, and we must work together to tackle this problem as quickly as possible.""Meanwhile Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's Deputy Health Minister Abdel-Fattah Mashat was quoted on the state-linked news site Al-Yaum saying that groups of visitors to Mecca from inside the country would now also be barred from performing the pilgrimage, known as the umrah. The crowds typically are made up of foreign residents going as large groups. Individuals and families in the kingdom can still travel to Mecca.Saudi Arabia last week closed off the holiest sites in Islam to foreign pilgrims over the coronavirus, disrupting travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affecting plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage."
212,"Aditya Puri successor: HDFC Bank recasts search panel, Keki Mistry replaced by Renu Karnad","MUMBAI :HDFC Bank has reconstituted the search panel instituted to find the successor to Aditya Puri, the managing director and chief executive of the 25-year-old private sector lender, the private lender informed the bourses on Wednesday. Keki Mistry has been replaced by Renu Karnad of the bank's parent HDFC in the search panel. Mistry leaves the board of the bank after completing eight consecutive years as a director -- the maximum tenure that regulation allows.Puri, who built HDFC Bank from scratch since its inception in 1994 and made it the second largest lender with more than  ₹9 lakh crore assets, is the highest paid banker in the country and is retiring on October 26, 2020.Puri succession is keenly watched by the industry as the new person will have to fill in a very large shoe, given the way Puri has built the bank that commands the highest premium among the banking stocks across the world and also the best asset quality among the all omestic lenders.Speculation is intense on whether the bank will pick an internal or an external candidate.On November 28, 2019, the bank had set up a six-member panel to find a successor to Puri who turns 70 on October 26, 2020.Weeks into the appointment of the search panel, the bank had roped in international headhunting firm Egon Zehnder to assist the panel identify the right candidate.The reconstituted search panel drops Keki Mistry, representing the parent HDFC and is replaced by Renu Karnad of the largest mortgage lender, the bank informed the exchanges this evening.The filing attributed the exclusion of Mistry, who is the vice-chairman, managing director and chief executive of HDFC from the panel to ""the cessation of his (Mistry's) directorship from the board of the bank and Karnad's appointment as an additional non-executive director on the board of the bank.""HDFC Bank in a separate filing said that Karnad has been appointed as Additional Non-Executive Director -- nominee of promoter Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited - on the board of the bank.Aditya Puri shall continue to act as advisor to the search committee, a position he held in the original panel as well, the filing said.Karnad is the joint managing director at the mortgage major.The other members of the panel include Shyamala Gopinath who is also the chairman of the bank, Sanjiv Sachar, MD Ranganath, Sandeep Parekh and Srikanth Nadhamuni.The bank's number two position fell vacant after Paresh Sukthankar, the deputy managing director who was considered as a front-runner to succeed Puri, put in his papers last year.At the annual general meeting in 2019, Puri had said that his replacement should be better than him and should not require 18 months handholding for the job.Industry is keenly watching the succession as Puri, hired by HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh from Citibank to start HDFC Bank in 1994, steps down in October after creating a behemoth with a market value of  ₹6.3 lakh crore as of today having scaled past  ₹7.5 lakh crore in recent past."
213,Why protectionism won’t boost India’s trade,"India’s shift towards protectionism continued with announcements in the 2020 Budget. In the budget, the government announced a slew protectionist measures to lower imports and address India’s growing trade deficit. According to new research, though, this is the wrong diagnosis. India’s trade deficit is more a result of stagnating exports than too many imports, argue Biswajit Dhar and Ramaa Arun Kumar in the Economic and Political Weekly. In the study, they use historic trade data to examine how all the trade-related announcements in the 2020 budget will affect India’s position in global trade. Data shows that merchandise exports grew by 8% in the current decade as opposed to 17.3% in the previous decade. The growth was even lower in the second half of this decade (at 1.4% between 2014-15 to 2018-19). This slump comes even after India’s major exports, such as electrical and non-electrical machinery, organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals, face low tariffs in global markets. The slowdown in exports is driven by the lack of competitiveness of Indian producers and the failure to meet global product standards.Despite this, the budget took the protectionist path and focused on increasing import tariffs and removing exemptions. While the objective was to create a level playing field for India’s micro, small and medium enterprises and encouraging domestic production, tariff protection alone is not enough to boost India’s manufacturing sector. The authors argue that India needs a holistic industrial policy that addresses low productivity, lack of credit, weak marketing strategies, lack of product standards and poor infrastructure. Doing this could make Indian exports more competitive and ease India’s trade deficit.Also read: Union Budget and the Trade SectorSnap Fact features new and interesting reads from the world of research."
214,Coronavirus update: Is COVID-19 has different strains? Scientists 'yes',"SHANGHAI :Scientists in China studying the coronavirus outbreak said they had found two main types of the disease could be causing infections. The researchers, from Peking University's School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cautioned that their analysis examined a limited range of data, and said follow-up studies of larger data sets are needed to better understand the virus's evolution.The preliminary study found that a more aggressive type of the new coronavirus associated with the disease outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analysed strains, while 30% was linked to a less aggressive type.The prevalence of the more aggressive virus decreased after early January 2020, they said.""These findings strongly support an urgent need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and chart records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" they wrote.Their findings were published on Tuesday in the National Science Review, the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Also on Wednesday, one of China's top medical associations confirmed that the median incubation period of the coronavirus is five to seven days and the maximum 14 days.The remarks by Du Bin, chairman of the critical care medical branch of the Chinese Medical Association, mark the most conclusive assessment of the virus' incubation period by a government-affiliated medical organization to date.The revelations came amid a fall in new coronavirus cases following crippling restrictions imposed on the world's second largest economy to stop its spread, including transport suspensions and the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.New cases downMainland China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said, down from 125 the previous day, in a broad trend that has seen numbers of new cases fall from the middle of February.The total number of cases on the mainland has now reached 80,270. The number of deaths rose by 38 to bring the total toll for mainland China to 2,981 by March 3.All but one new death occurred in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.With the number of new daily infections overseas now exceeding new cases in China, Chinese officials have begun to seek ways to control the spread of the virus outside of China and guard against future outbreaks.Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places.An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran, one of the virus' new hotspots, last week.China is encouraging domestic producers of medical protective equipment to export protective suits to meet overseas demand as the virus spreads, Cao Xuejun, an official with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.China's health authorities are also studying setting up emergency reserves for medical resources and protective materials, Mao Qunan, an official at China's National Health Commission said at the same briefing."
215,"Government detaches GAIL, OIL, other PSUs from AGR case","NEW DELHI :The government has detached gas utility GAIL India, explorer Oil India and other PSUs from a Supreme Court order that had led to  ₹1.47 lakh crore being sought from telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in past dues, the Lok Sabha was informed on Wednesday. Following the October 24 order of the Supreme Court asking inclusion of non-telecom revenues for calculating statutory dues such as license fee and spectrum charges of telecom firms, the Department of Telecommunications has sought a cumulative  ₹2.7 lakh crore from GAIL and other non-telecom PSUs.The demand was challenged by state-owned firms.""Supreme Court has detached the public sector undertakings (PSUs) from the AGR judgment dated October 24, 2019, and directed them to seek relief from an appropriate forum,"" Minister of State for Communications Sanjay Dhotre said in a written reply to a question in the Lower House of Parliament.The DoT had sought  ₹1.83 lakh crore from GAIL and  ₹48,489 crore from OIL by including their revenues from oil and gas business in calculating dues for leasing out surplus bandwidth capacity to third parties. Power Grid Corp was slapped with  ₹21,953.65 crore liability and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd faced  ₹15,019.97 crore demand. RailTel and Delhi Metro too faced similar demands.""Public sector undertakings such as GAIL, Oil India, etc represented to Department of Telecom that the AGR judgment is not applicable on them and therefore they do not owe any dues to the Department of Telecom,"" Dhotre said.The challenge to such demand was heard by the apex court last month.""After the Supreme Court order dated February 14, 2020, the government abides by the orders of Supreme Court,"" he said.On February 14, the Supreme Court had pulled up the DoT for not enforcing its October 24 order that gave telcos three months' time to pay dues. Hours later, the DoT sent notices to Airtel and Vodafone Idea asking them to clear dues immediately.To a separate question, Dhotre said the government has received  ₹15,896.5 crore payment from telecom companies towards AGR liabilities and  ₹1,30,440.4 crore remained to be paid.This number, however, does not seem to reflect the latest tranche of payment made by Bharti Airtel on February 29.Detailing out payments made by telecom companies to the DoT towards statutory dues, Dhotre informed that against the provisional total dues of  ₹1,46,336.9 crore, payment to the tune of  ₹15,896.5 crore has been received.Bharti Airtel paid  ₹10,000 crore, with  ₹27,740 crore balance remaining, he said, adding Vodafone Idea has paid  ₹3,500 crore and  ₹49,538 crore remained due.Similarly, Tata Group paid  ₹2,197.3 crore, and  ₹11,625 crore remained due.OIL, the nation's second-biggest state-owned oil producer, holds a National Long Distance Service Licence (NLD) with primary objective of monitoring and operation of its pipeline network.The surplus bandwidth capacity available with the company was leased out to the telecom operators/other users, on which the company regularly paid the applicable license fee to the telecom department (DoT).But, after the October 24 Supreme Court ruling for including non-telecom revenues for calculating dues, the DoT included all revenues from oil and gas to seek  ₹48,489 crore from the company for the period from 2007-08 to 2018-19.In case of GAIL, which held a IP-II licence, the DoT assessed  ₹1,83,076 crore as outstanding after including interest and penalty computed on the entire revenue of the company.PowerGrid, which holds NLD and Internet Service Provider (ISP) licences, was asked to pay  ₹21,953.65 crore (including interest and penalty) for FY 2012-13 to FY 2017-18 by adding revenue related to power transmission and consultancy as 'miscellaneous income' in adjusted gross revenue, company sources said, adding the firm will approach the TDSAT in next few days.Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd, which had a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) and a Category 'A' ISP, was asked to pay  ₹15,019.97 crore for the financial year 2005-06 to 2018-19.

216,"TikTok owner Bytedance launches ‘India first’ music streaming platform, Resso","Bytedance, owner of popular short-video platform TikTok, today launched its music streaming service called Resso. The app will take on homegrown competitors like Gaana and JioSaavn, alongside global giants in the space like Spotify and Apple Music. While Resso is being first launched in India, Hari Nair, Head of Music Content and Partnership at Resso India said the idea is to be a global music streaming platform. The app wants to differentiate itself from others by taking elements from TikTok, which add a social aspect to music streaming.Resso has a proprietary recommendation algorithm inside, which recommends playlists created by one user to others. The app’s user interface follows the same swipe up-down model as TikTok, and it has a feature called “vibes"", which allows users to add their own GIFs, images and videos to the platform, which will then be seen by others.So, unlike most platforms, album art isn’t the only artwork you will see while playing music. Since Resso allows users to generate content for the Vibes feature, it has a content moderation team that decides what can be uploaded. The company didn’t share how many people it has in this team.While Resso calls itself the world’s first social streaming platform, others have tried adding social elements before. Pandora and Rdio, two of the earliest and failed music streaming platforms were known for trying to get users to interact on the platform.The objective seems to be to keep a user on the app while listening to music. Nair said that Resso wants to turn music listening from a “passive to an active experience"". Resso wants people to open the app, look at vibes and interact with the platform. What’s unclear is why it wants to do so.According to Nair, the company doesn’t plan to add advertisements to the platform anytime soon. He said monetisation plans haven’t been discussed right now and the focus is solely on user acquisition. But Resso does have a paid tier (Rs. 99 per month for Android and Rs. 119 per month for iOS), which means there will be restrictions for free users in future.Music streaming services, especially in India, primarily earn from in-stream advertisements at the moment. Gaana, for example, places banner ads on the platform other than the voice ads playing between songs. In an interaction with Mint, Prashan Agarwal, Gaana CEO, said that less than a minute of ads are played on streaming services per hour of listening, which is a very small number.If Resso succeeds in having users stick to the platform and actually interact with the service, then it could open up new ad revenue streams. For instance, the vibes feature could be used to place ads on the platform, just like Instagram places ads between Stories. Resso also lets users comment on others Vibes, which potentially increases the overall time a user spends on the app.Nair said it’ll be at least a year or two before Indian users start before paying for streaming services, and Resso has no plans to start putting ads on the platforms at least in the short run."
217,India’s desultory Covid operations,"India on Wednesday stepped up its preparedness to tackle the spread of the deadly coronaviral disease, Covid-19. It has mandated indiscriminate screening of passengers flying into the country from around the world. New Delhi had earlier put passengers from 12 countries under the scanner. The move comes after confirmed cases of coronavirus infections rose to 28. Reports suggest that more than 10 major and over 50 minor seaports in India are being screened, with 21 major airports also deploying devices to detect symptoms of the disease—characterized by fever, cough and respiratory difficulties. Screenings are necessary to spot those who have the disease, but not sufficient insofar as containment of the outbreak is concerned. What makes the virus a slippery customer is its resilience. It has a long incubation period—up to two weeks—during which it is contagious. This means that infected people can spread the disease inadvertently, as symptoms may not yet have shown up. Thus, there is a high likelihood of several infected passengers slipping through airport dragnet.The basic objective of airport screening, global experts concede, is to give people a psychological sense of safety. Without it, they would feel far less assured. But this does not mean it is a pointless exercise. Catching those who have fallen ill is important, and it could happen over the course of a long-haul flight. Cases in India seem on the verge of spiralling up, and the battle to keep the virus out may already have been lost. It is now time to focus on domestic healthcare. A credible public communication campaign needs to be mounted as well."
218,"NCLAT dismisses Deloitte, KPMG and auditors pleas against impleadment in IL&FS matter","NEW DELHI :The NCLAT on Wednesday dismissed the pleas of auditors of debt-ridden IL&FS -- Deloitte Haskins & Sells and KPMG arm BSR & Associates -- along with independent directors challenging their impleadment in the case of alleged fraud at a group firm IFIN. A two-member bench of the NCLAT upheld the directions of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, saying it can not be termed as ""illegal"". The NCLT had directed them to implead the auditors and independent directors as party.The NCLT is empowered to pass order to implead them under Section 242 of the Companies Act, 2013 in a petition under Section 241(2) if ""it forms opinion that the affairs of the company have been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the public interest"", the appellate tribunal further said.""Once such opinion is formed by the Tribunal, it may pass any order as it deem fit and proper,""said the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) bench headed by Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya.The case relates to IFIN, a subsidiary of IL&FS.Rejecting the contention of the auditors and others that they cannot be treated as part of the management, which is responsible for managing the affairs of the company and therefore should not be charged as per the said section, the NCLAT said that rules of natural justice are to be followed.""As rules of natural justice are to be followed, if any order is passed against one or other, including investigation, it is always open to the Tribunal to ask such party to be impleaded,"" the NCLAT said.The MCA had asked the NCLT to freeze the assets of the former auditors in the case, involving alleged fraud in IFIN.The appellate tribunal, however, granted relief to both the auditors and other independent directors by allowing the operation of its earlier interim order passed on July 29, 2019 for two weeks.After the judgment was pronounced by the NCLAT in the open court, a request was made by counsels, representing accounting firms and other independent directors, to allow the interim order passed by it on July 29, 2019 to to continue for another two weeks, which was accepted by the appellate tribunal.""We allow the prayer and continue the interim order passed on 29th July, 2019 for another two weeks,"" the bench said.On July 29, the NCLAT stayed the order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to implead the auditors and independent directors of IL&FS.Earlier on July 23, the NCLT had allowed the plea of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to implead the auditors and independent directors of IFIN.Moreover, visualsing the possible impact of IL&FS crisis on the Indian economy, the NCLAT in its 72-page-long order said that various acts ""prejudicial to public interest"" have been highlighted, which has cascading impact on various sectors of economy and even the Department of Economic Affairs -- which is responsible for the financial stability of the country -- too has raised ""Red Signals"" of the likely collapse of 'IL&FS' in its confidential note dated September 30, 2018.""In the circumstances, before passing any appropriate order in public interest and to save the economy of the Country from collapse, if the Tribunal is of the opinion that it requires to give appropriate hearing to the concerned parties, including those who audited 'IL&FS' and/ or those who have managed or were concerned with 'IL&FS' or its Group Companies, it cannot be held to be illegal.""We find no merit in these appeals. They are accordingly, dismissed,"" the NCLAT said.The central government had submitted that the act of fraud perpetuated is on account of ""mis-representation and falsehoods about the financial state of affairs"" of the concerned company, which has jeopardized the financial health apart from causing serious damage and financial loss to various stakeholders.However, the tribuanl said that as the matter is still pending before the NCLT, it is ""not inclined to express any opinion whether the allegations made against one or other require further investigation and the order what is required to be passed in public interest"".While commenting on the development, Deloite India spokesperson said: ""We will review the written order before determining our further course of action, which may include an appeal"".Auditors cannot be treated as part of the management which is responsible for managing the affairs of the company and therefore should not be charged, the spokesperson said.""We will continue to present and protect its position, supported by the facts, to the relevant authorities. The firm remains committed to high standards of audit quality and ethical conduct in its professional practice,"" he added.Meanwhile, BSR & Associates also said that they are reviewing the NCLAT order and will explore options.""We are reviewing the order and will explore appropriate steps as required. We do not anticipate this order impacting our ability to continue providing high quality audit services to our clients. BSR is committed to, and bears responsibility and accountability for, the highest ethical and quality standards in its audits,"" said a BSR spokesperson."
219,Delhi violence: SC asks Delhi HC to hear hate speech case on 6 March,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi High Court to list and hear the plea seeking registration of FIRs against politicians for alleged hate speech on 6 March. The apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, also said a long adjournment in the case was not justified. Ten people affected by the Delhi violence had filed petitions in the Delhi high court for registration of the FIRs.“We are not directing, we are asking High Court to list it on Friday,"" said the top court bench.The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant, asked the chief justice of Delhi high court to expeditiously deal with the petitions and connected intervention and impleadment pleas. The bench also asked the Delhi high court to advance the date of other connected matters from April.""The high court may explore the possibility of peaceful resolutions of the disputes,"" said the bench.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, apprised the court of a video clip where activist Harsh Mander is seen making hate speeches amid anti-CAA protests. Mehta, referring to Mander's alleged speech, said it had made some ""objectionable"" statements against the court.Taking a note of the speech in the video, the bench said, ""This is what you think of this court. Before we hear you (counsel for Mander), you see the allegations and respond to them.""The top court also directed Mehta to file a sworn affidavit on behalf of the Centre about the allegations against Mander and the transcript of the video as well.Advocate Karuna Nandy, representing Mander, denied that Mander had made any such hate speeches as alleged by the Centre.The three-judge bench clarified that it shall not hear Mander’s petition till the allegations against him are sorted out.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the riot-affected people, argued his case, which will be heard next on Friday."
220,Bottled drinking water to cost  ₹13 a litre in Kerala down from  ₹20,"Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala government has issued an order capping the retail price of bottled drinking water at  ₹13 per litre. The order, issued by the civil supplies department on Tuesday, states that the price should not exceed  ₹13 for one litre and all bottles should have the new price printed.A litre of drinking water is now priced at  ₹20.The Left government had earlier decided to bring packaged water under the ambit of the Essential Commodities Act.The government decided to regulate the price of bottled water following widespread complaints from the public about its exorbitant price.Though the government had mulled cutting short its price to  ₹11-12 two years ago, it could not be implemented due to the protest from large-scale bottled water manufacturers and traders.The price cut was possible as bottled water has been made an essential commodity.The Kerala Bottled Water Manufacturers Association has said they were willing to bring down the MRP to  ₹12 two years ago itself, but a group of members were against it.There are 200 odd packaged drinking water manufacturers in the state and some are allegedly functioning without license against whom the government would have to take action.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

To another question on whether the government intends to propose a plan for future development in the telecom sector in view of the huge Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) fees required to be paid by telcos, Minister of State for Communications, Sanjay Dhotre said there is ""no such plan at present"".On speculations regarding shutting down of Vodafone Idea, Dhotre said no such information is available with the government.On whether the government proposes to initiate any action over non-compliance of order on payment of dues by telcos, Dhotre pointed out that the Centre had directed the licensees to make the payments in accordance with October 24 order of the Supreme Court.""As per license agreement, the Government takes action against licensees including Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) over non-compliance of Supreme Court order dated October 24, 2019 on payment of dues of Department of Telecommunication,"" he said.Detailing out payments made by telecom companies to the DoT towards statutory dues, Dhotre informed that against the provisional total dues of  ₹1,46,336.9 crore, payment to the tune of  ₹15,896.5 crore have been received.The balance dues are about  ₹1,30,440.47 crore, the minister said.However, the number does not appear to reflect the latest tranche of payment made by Bharti Airtel on February 29.It has placed Bharti Airtel's payments (including Telenor) at  ₹10,000 crore, with balance dues at  ₹27,740 crore.As per the data available, Reliance Communication/Reliance Telecommunication have made payment of  ₹3.96 crore, with remaining dues pegged at  ₹21,135.6 crore.Giving out TSPs-wise payments and provisional balance dues, Dhotre informed that Vodafone Idea has paid  ₹3,500 crore, putting the balance dues at  ₹49,538 crore.The due amounts may be revised once AGR figures are finalised and assessments are accordingly done and also subject to C&AG Audit/Special Audit, it said.According to the information presented, Tata Group has paid  ₹2,197.3 crore, and its balance dues are at  ₹11,625 crore.In case of Reliance Jio, the payment of  ₹195.18 crore received and exceeded dues of  ₹60.52 crore, the information showed.State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mananagar Telephone Nigam Ltd have not made any payments towards their liabilities.The balance dues of BSNL remains at  ₹4,989.4 crore and of MTNL at  ₹3,122.8 crore.Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) such as GAIL, Oil India and others represented to Department of Telecom that the AGR judgment is not applicable on them and therefore they do not owe any dues to the department.The minister also noted that the Supreme Court has detached the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) from the AGR judgement of October, 2019 and directed them to seek relief from appropriate forum.""After the Supreme Court order dated 14.02.2020, the Government abides by the orders of Supreme Court,"" Dhotre said.

222,Coronavirus update: Decade-old medicine emerges as hope for COVID-19 victims,"BEIJING/ZURICH :China has approved the use of Swiss drugmaker Roche's anti-inflammation drug Actemra for patients who develop severe complications from the coronavirus as it urgently hunts for new ways to combat the deadly infection that is spreading worldwide. China is hoping that some older drugs could stop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), or cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system which is considered a major factor behind catastrophic organ failure and death in some coronavirus patients.Actemra, a biologic drug approved in 2010 in the United States for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inhibits high Interleukin 6 (IL-6) protein levels that drive some inflammatory diseases.China's National Health Commission said in treatment guidelines published online on Wednesday that Actemra can now be used to treat coronavirus patients with serious lung damage and high IL-6 levels.Separately, researchers in the country are testing Actemra, known generically as tocilizumab, in a clinical trial expected to include 188 coronavirus patients and running until May 10.Roche, which donated 14 million yuan ($2.02 million) worth of Actemra during February, said the trial was initiated independently by a third party with the aim of exploring the efficacy and safety of the drug in coronavirus patients with CRS.It added that there was currently no published clinical trial data on the drug's safety or efficacy against the virus.More than 3,000 people have died and 93,000 have been infected by the novel coronavirus thought to have originated in Wuhan, China, before spreading to around 90 countries including the United States, Italy, Switzerland, France and Germany.The Swiss company, for which China is its No. 2 market behind the United States, also makes diagnostic gear to detect the coronavirus.Since Actemra's approval a decade ago, it has become a go-to drug against other inflammatory conditions, including cytokine storms in cancer patients receiving cell therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences.In 2012 it helped save the life of a young US girl, the first child to be treated for leukaemia with Novatis' Kymriah, from a post-treatment rush of IL-6.Priced at between $20-30,000 annually for RA according to SSR Health, Roche's medicine is also used for rare juvenile arthritis and giant cell arteritis, or inflammation of the blood vessels.China's National Medical Product Administration has yet to give its approval for Actemra to be sold for use in coronavirus infection cases and Chinese drugmakers are also racing to develop alternatives to Roche's treatment.Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd expects to file new drug approval for a version of Actemra in 2021, while Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co Ltd in 2016 got regulatory approval to hold trials for an Actemra copy, company filings showed.

The incident that took place on February 21 came to light after the passenger Tejaswini Divya Naik posted videos about it on social media.Naik booked a cab from Pune to go to her home at Andheri in Mumbai at around 1 pm on February 21.""Initially, the driver was constantly on the phone and I told him not to use the phone while driving. After he put the phone down, he started falling asleep,"" she said.At one point, the driver almost hit another car and a divider, Naik alleged, adding that she offered to drive the car if he needed to nap for a while.""When he finally relented, I took the wheel and told him that he could sleep for half an hour as I would not drive for long because of my back problem,"" said Naik, who works in the film industry.But instead of sleeping while Naik drove, the cab driver kept talking on the phone and even praised her driving skills, she said.When the driver finally slept, she clicked photos and videos of him naping for proof, Naik said, adding that she later posted a video of the incident on social media and tagged the cab company.Just half an hour before reaching the destination, the driver woke up and took over his duties, Naik said.When contacted, Uber's spokesperson, in an email stated, ""This is a regrettable and concerning incident.

227,RBI may use unconventional tools to combat coronavirus impact: Report,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is considering using unconventional policy tools to spur lending, three government officials told Reuters, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will derail any revival of economic growth. RBI is planning to infuse fresh cash liquidity into the system through a second round of long-term repo operations (LTRO), three sources aware of the matter told Reuters. They asked not to be named as discussions were still private.Globally, central banks are taking steps to provide liquidity to stabilize financial markets, which have sunk as the coronavirus spread over more than 80 countries.The Federal Reserve slashed U.S. interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday in an emergency move.Central banks in Australia and Malaysia also cut rates and on Monday the Bank of Japan took steps to provide liquidity to stabilize financial markets there.One of the officials said the Reserve Bank of India might inject as much as 1 trillion rupees ($13.62 billion) in a new round of LTROs that begin as early as April.Funds are being offered at the repo rate of 5.15% as part of the operations, far cheaper than existing market rates for three-year funds. That helps banks secure cheaper funding, which can then be passed on to consumers, helping to boost demand.India's finance ministry and RBI did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment.""LTROs is one of the tools on the table and it clearly has been very well-received,"" another official said.Currently, the bank is carrying out 1 trillion rupees of LTRO operations announced on Feb. 6. It has so far completed three of four expected tranches. The last is on March 9.""LTRO is more impactful in lowering costs for banks and thus can be said to be a more powerful tool than an outright rate cut at this stage,"" said a senior source with a state-run lender.The central bank said on Tuesday it was monitoring global and domestic developments closely and stood ready to act to maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability."
228,"SC crypto ruling welcome, but industry wary of Indian government","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court quashing the Reserve Bank of India’s order that banned financial services firms from trading in cryptocurrency has been well received by the industry, but most still remain wary of taking the next step. The general thinking in the industry seems to be that the SC’s ruling is only the first step, and it can’t yet trust a government that has been publicly against allowing crypto exchanges and startups function effectively in India. “There’s still a bill that the Parliament has to discuss. It has changed shapes and forms but hopefully this will be the framework for how cryptocurrency is traded in the country,"" said Prashant Swaminathan, founder & CEO of Tandem, a peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading platform.A draft bill had earlier proposed a ban on the use of cryptocurrency in India and also a jail term for those dealing in it. Stakeholders in the industry say that while the SC’s verdict is certainly going to increase confidence in India, regulations are more important.Regulations will clarify how much freedom cryptocurrency businesses and exchanges will have to operate in India. That’s important for big global exchanges to make their entry into the market and for Indian startups to do well. “India is a big market, but a lot of companies have kept away from the market,"" said Vincent Poon, vice president, Bithumb Global, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.Poon said many of his peers have been taking note of the SC ruling, meaning it could open doors for global companies to come into the market. But he agreed that the ruling was only the beginning and without regulations and a legal system, India wouldn’t be a concrete market for those firms to explore.On the other hand, most executives agreed that the SC’s ruling clears any confusion around the legality of using cryptocurrencies in India. “People who were questioning the legality of cryptocurrencies will now realise that their perspectives were wrong, and only banks were barred from dealing in crypto,"" said Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, a well known cryptocurrency processor in India.“I think what’s likely to happen now is that (Indian) exchanges which had shut down after the RBI’s order will reopen,"" said Vishal Gupta, founder of multiple crypto-based startups, like SearchTrade and Binex. “No one will be looking to make any fresh investments, but the existing businesses who have already set up shop (will benefit),"" said Gupta.Gupta expects the total trading in cryptocurrencies will increase right now. “Volumes in the Indian market could increase by 100, 200 or even 500 times,"" he said. Before the ban, Indians traded approximately 2500 bitcoins per day, according to Gupta. He expects the number to be even higher in the next three to four months.The common consensus seems to be that it’s too early to call anything based on the SC’s ruling. “At the outset, what it looks like is that at least common sense has prevailed. But I wouldn’t go far as to say that this is the start of positive regulation for crypto,"" said Raghu Mohan, co-founder of IBC Media."
229,"Oyo to cut about 5,000 jobs in overhaul, says report","Oyo Hotels is cutting its global workforce by about 5,000 to 25,000 people, with the deepest reductions in China after business there crumbled in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The Indian startup, one of the largest in SoftBank Group Corp.’s portfolio, is reducing staff in China, the US and its home country as it seeks to boost profitability. Oyo expanded rapidly after its founding in 2013 and reached a valuation of $10 billion, but investors have soured on money-losing businesses after WeWork’s meltdown and SoftBank has pushed portfolio companies to prioritize profitability.“In our previous phase, we added a lot of properties to our platform and built the brand and mindshare,"" said founder and Chief Executive Officer Ritesh Agarwal in an interview. “Our first focus of 2020 is growth with profitability.""Agarwal said the global headcount would fall by about 17% from 30,000 in January. The company is also prioritizing improved relations with hotels and stronger corporate governance, he said. The worldwide overhaul was in full swing, he added. “By the time our restructuring process is complete, OYO will have over 25,000 employees worldwide,"" he said.The coronavirus is contributing to a dramatic retrenchment in China, a market once deemed crucial to Oyo’s global expansion. The company intends to fire about half its 6,000 direct full-time staff in the country, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing internal targets. Of the remaining 4,000 so-called discretionary workers -- hired in support areas such as call centers and clients’ hotels -- a portion will be temporarily laid off but invited back once business recovers, one of the people said.The staffing reductions are up sharply from an envisioned reduction of about 5% of Chinese employees prior to the epidemic, which abruptly chilled travel across the world’s No. 2 economy. It also follows the dismissal of 12% of its 10,000 staff in its home country of India, people familiar with the matter have said.The accelerated downsizing is a setback for Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, whose portfolio has been buffeted by WeWork’s infamous implosion and volatile share prices at once high-flying Slack Technologies Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. The billionaire has called for greater financial discipline among the founders in his portfolio, spurring job cuts at outfits such as Zume Pizza Inc.Other SoftBank portfolio companies, including Getaround, Wag Labs Inc., and Brandless Inc., have had to cut staff or change business models once it became apparent revenue and profits were not living up to once-grand ambitions.""In China, the coronavirus has hit us and in specific provinces, we are trying hard to keep hotels open, as many as possible,"" said Agarwal. “It’s a tough time for our hotel partners.""Hotel owners in China had protested in front of the company’s offices, accusing the startup of violating contractual agreements. The growing turmoil may complicate SoftBank’s efforts to raise a successor to the Vision Fund, the world’s largest pool of startup investments.Oyo’s Japanese business also has been plagued with problems. After a chaotic rush to expand in Asia’s second-largest economy, the startup alienated potential partners, workers and some customers, according to interviews with more than two dozen of them.Son has been a keen supporter of Agarwal, helping fund the hotel company’s fast international expansion. Oyo had been growing at a rapid clip, but its reputation has suffered due to customer complaints about bad experiences along with grievances about poor or unfair treatment from several of the more than 20,000 hotel owners in its chain.SoftBank’s Vision Fund has so far invested about $1.5 billion in Oyo. The company also counts Airbnb Inc., Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners as backers. It promoted its real estate business chief, Rohit Kapoor, to CEO for India and South Asia in December to shake up the business.In its aggressive effort to acquire market share, Oyo offered hotel stays for as cheap as $4 a night, according to one person familiar with its practices. The company also stocked up on rented room inventory by signing exclusive deals and guaranteeing income to hotel owners. Agarwal and Son have both said their goal was to make Oyo into the largest hotel operator in the world by room count, surpassing Marriott International Inc., founded in 1927.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

235,OPEC pushing Russia to support big oil output cut amid coronavirus,"Vienna: Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members were seeking to win support from Russia on Wednesday to join them in new additional oil output cuts to prop up prices which have tumbled by a fifth this year because of the coronavirus outbreak. A technical panel of several representatives from OPEC states, Russia and other producers recommended on Tuesday cutting output by between 0.6-1.0 million barrels per day (bpd) during the second quarter only.It also recommended that existing cuts of 2.1 million bpd by the group known as OPEC , which meets in Vienna this week, be extended until the end of 2020.Russia has so far signalled it might be willing to agree to extending existing cuts, which expire in March, but might find it difficult to sign up to deeper cuts.""OPEC hopes for a cut bigger than 1 million but the challenge is still Russia,"" an OPEC source said. Two other sources confirmed talks were now focusing on additional cuts in excess of 1 million bpd.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman met his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak on Wednesday. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), comprising a handful of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers, will convene in Vienna on Wednesday.The Saudi and Russian ministers have made no public statements so far since arriving to Vienna.'DOWNWARD REVISIONS'Sources told Reuters this month the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could agree deeper cuts even without Russia. One source said on Wednesday that Russia would seek to keep its participation in any new cut to a minimum.""Cuts will need to at least be towards the top end of the range, as we see further downward revisions in demand growth as Covid-19 spreads. There is more evidence of the spread of the virus having an impact on demand outside of China,"" Warren Patterson from ING said in a note.Existing cuts have not been enough to counter the impact of the new coronavirus, Covid-19, on China, the world's biggest oil importer, and on the global economy. Factories have been disrupted, fewer people are travelling and other business has slowed, driving down oil demand.Benchmark Brent oil prices were around $52 a barrel on Wednesday, a level at which many OPEC states will struggle to balance their budgets, although Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the current price was acceptable.With global efforts to prevent the virus spreading, OPEC has said the number of delegates at its meetings in Vienna this week will be kept to a minimum and journalists have been barred from entering the OPEC headquarters.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh arrived for the talks in Vienna as Iran's government said the virus had now affected most of the provinces in the Islamic Republic.Wednesday's JMMC meeting is part of the process of drawing up recommendations for the wider meeting of ministers from OPEC on Thursday and a meeting of OPEC ministers on Friday.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

236,Stanza Living to invest  ₹150 crore to tap working professionals segment,"BENGALURU: Student housing startup Stanza Living on Wednesday said it will venture into managed housing for working professionals with a capacity of 10,000 beds in four cities. It will add an additional 50,000 beds in the new segment and invest  ₹150 crore for the expansion. The managed housing startup will initially focus on adding working professionals in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and Coimbatore, with plans to expand into three more cities by the next quarter.With the new proposition, Stanza Living will take on bigger startups in the co-living space such as Nestaway, Zolo Stays, and Oyo which also offers shared housing under the OYO Life brand.Delhi-based Stanza Living started operations in July 2017 with 100 beds focused on student accommodation in Delhi University’s North campus area, and has since aggressively expanded more than 10 cities. Till date, the startup claims to have added a total of 55,000 beds, including the working professionals segment.The startup has raised total funding of around $70 million till date from global investors like Falcon Edge Capital, Sequoia Capital, Accel, Matrix Partners, and Alteria Capital. It was last valued at $300 million in its Series C round in July 2019.According to Stanza Living, the existing shared-living sector in India is fragmented and unorganized and suffers from “service quality gaps like ill-maintained and cramped buildings, poor quality food, lack of access to daily facilities"".Anindya Dutta, managing director, Stanza Living, in an interview, said the startup conducted extensive market research and interviews with working professionals and freshers to figure out gaps in co-living services.""From our conversations it was clear that more professionals are choosing to use co-living products over self-owned apartments since access to rented apartments are increasingly becoming difficult for them. Gated communities and welfare associations are increasingly turning their back on working professionals,"" Dutta said.He added that the co-living market, especially the segment focused on working professionals is expected to touch $10 billion in India over the next 5 years. ""The size of working professionals market is almost as same as the student market, and we will realize the same revenue margins in the new segment that we are already seeing in the student housing market"" added Dutta.Stanza Living will offer features like live cafes and kitchens, chef-curated meals, WiFi, laundry service, housekeeping and round the clock security with the working professionals product. Each bed or room is expected to be priced in the range of  ₹4,000- ₹15,000.“Our foray into the working professional's category follows the journey of our student consumers. As they graduate and become potential migrant working professionals, we want to continue delivering an aspirational lifestyle solution adaptable to their evolving needs, wherever they migrate. We are excited to launch our holistic value proposition with 10,000 beds addressing the discerning needs of the diverse migrant working population,"" said Sandeep Dalmia, co-founder, Stanza Living."

243,"Expect a lower salary hike this year, courtesy slowdown","NEW DELHI :Companies operating in India are likely to give an average salary hike of 7.8 per cent to their employees for the financial year 2020-21, according to a survey by Deloitte India. The lower salary increment, as compared to the preceding year, is in line with the higher margin pressure on companies, economic headwinds, and the need to gradually slow white-collar pay growth in India to become more globally competitive, Deloitte India said. ""Companies in India are likely to give an average salary increment of 7.8 percent to employees for 2020-21. This projected salary increment is 40 basis points lower than the actual salary increment of 8.2 per cent that employees received in 2019-20,"" the survey report, titled 'Workforce and Increment Trends Survey', said.Anandorup Ghose, partner at Deloitte India, said, ""There has been a lot of debate on pay increases over the past few years and there is a need for greater responsibility in this process of salary budgeting as compensation cost ratios are increasingly becoming a sore point in boardrooms across the country.""Ghose also said the talent market priorities are different from what they were five years ago, and companies' pay budgeting process and data needs to reflect that.The survey found that almost 50 per cent of the companies surveyed are projecting a salary increment of less than 8 per cent for 2020-21 and only 8 per cent companies are expecting to offer pay increases greater than 10 per cent.More than 30 per cent of the respondent companies, the report said, differentiate increments by levels of management.The projected salary increments for 2020-21 are expected to be the lowest in industries such as infrastructure and real estate, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and telecom, the report said.""To manage overall cost budgets, organisations focus on differentiation. Performance and potential differentiation remains the central theme according to the survey. Ninety per cent companies differentiate pay increases on the basis of past-year performance and 34 per cent companies focus on differentiating pay based on potential.""As the bell curve for companies has become sharper (with only 7 per cent employees achieving the highest rating), the differentiation in pay is almost 1.7 times the pay increase for average performers,"" the survey said.The survey also found that at an all-India level, voluntary attrition slightly reduced in the current financial year to about 15 per cent, involuntary attrition (layoffs, restructuring, etc) has increased to 20 per cent of the total attrition.Involuntary attrition increased the most in the automobile, insurance, and NBFC sectors. The survey findings also corroborated the increasing impact of automation on the workforce with companies showing reduced hiring levels, it added.The audience for the survey was HR professionals. About 300 organisations spread across 7 sectors and over 20 sub-sectors participated in the survey. The survey provides insights and market trends on salary increments, performance management trends, and information on emerging realities in the area of workforce composition and pay design, Deloitte India said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

This was a defensive strike to disrupt the attack,"" US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Sonny Leggett said in a Twitter post.The telephone conversation came three days after Baradar and US Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad signed an agreement in Qatar for withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.The deal is seen as a step towards ending the US’ more than 18-year stay in Afghanistan after the launch of the war on terrorism in 2001. A troop withdrawal would boost Trump’s bid for a second term as US president in the November elections given that he has made a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan a priority.The US-Taliban pact signed on 29 February calls for a phased withdrawal of US-led foreign forces from Afghanistan if the Taliban keeps its commitments. The US currently has about 13,000 troops in Afghanistan with the US president saying at a news conference in New Delhi on 25 February that he would bring down the number to 8,600 after the deal was signed. The US and the Taliban had also agreed that the latter would start the intra-Afghan dialogue on 10 March.However, with Afghan president Abdul Ghani refusing to set free 5,000 Taliban prisoners as per the US-Taliban accord, the deal hit a roadblock, according to news reports.Other news reports said the Taliban had on Monday said that a seven-day cessation of hostilities it had observed ahead of signing the pact with the US, had come to an end with the Taliban not targeting foreign forces but the Afghan defence personnel.According to Reuters news agency, Trump told reporters that he had a “very good conversation with the leader of the Taliban"".“They’re looking to get this ended, and we’re looking to get it ended... the relationship is very good that I have with the Mullah. We had a good, long conversation today,"" he said."
246,Coronavirus update: 16 at ITBP's Delhi facility test positive for COVID-19,"NEW DELHI :Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) on Wednesday said 16 out of 24 people who were shifted to its quarantine facility in Chhawla have tested positive for Coronavirus. ITBP Spokesperson, Vivek Pandey told ANI: ""16 out of 24 people who were shifted to ITBP quarantine facility have tested positive for Coronavirus. These people have been put in isolation. They are being monitored and their treatment is on.""""The situation is under control and there is no need to panic. We are taking action as per the Health Ministry guidelines on dealing with COVID-19,"" he added.Yesterday, 24 people including three Indians and 21 Italian nationals residing in a hotel in South Delhi were shifted to the ITBP quarantine facility.ITBP further said that no fresh symptoms of Coronavirus were seen in 112 people who had earlier been brought into the quarantine facility in Chhawla.""Today is the 7th day of those people. The second test of them has been conducted and if no symptoms are seen, we will release them,"" Pandey said.Earlier today the Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had said that there were 28 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the country.Global deaths due to Coronavirus outbreak has crossed 3,000. The deadly virus, that originated in China late last year, continues to spread around the world and has infected more than 90,000 people."
247,"Cabinet clears decriminalization of company law breaches, eases CSR rules","NEW DELHI :The Union cabinet on Wednesday cleared 72 amendments to the Companies Act, 2013, decriminalizing various offences and moderating the penalty regime to boost of ease doing business. The move to ease the rigors of compliance comes at a time when the Indian economy is going through a crippling slowdown due to a slump in consumption.A Bill to amend the Act is likely to be moved in Parliament during the current session to give effect to the changes.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that the proposed changes will make the Companies Act, 2013 ""more humane"".Sitharaman said a ministerial panel had looked into how many sections in the Companies Act caused businesses worries. “We suggested 72 changes to 65 sections in the Companies Act, 2013. In this set of amendments, the priority is to de-criminalise the Act. Majority of the changes are to remove criminality of the offences where no mala fide is intended. The major thrust is to improve the ease of doing business and to de-criminalise the law,"" the minister said.Sitharaman explained that the changes proposed include recategorising 23 offences of 66 compoundable offences in the Act. These will now be dealt under an in-house framework meant to adjudicate on the matter.“We are limiting punishments for 11 other compoundable offences to only fines by removing imprisonment. Five other offences will be dealt with under different alternative framework. Also, we are reducing the quantum of penalties offences which were de-criminalised earlier,"" the minister said.Besides these, from the point of ease of doing business, a lot of other steps are being taken, Sitharaman said. One such important step is exempting companies, which have an obligation to spend  ₹50 lakh or less from the requirement of having a corporate social responsibility committee.“Also, if a company spent more than 2% of net profit in one year, the general approach was to count only 2% under this obligation. Now we are allowing the excess amount spent to be carried over to be adjusted against the obligation of subsequent year,"" the minister said."
248,Coronavirus update: Pharma company says developing plasma therapy for the deadly virus,"TOKYO :Takeda Pharmaceutical Co said on Wednesday it was developing a drug for high-risk patients infected with the new coronavirus, joining several other drugmakers seeking to develop a treatment for an illness that has killed over 3,000 people. The Japanese firm said it was working on a plasma-derived therapy which had previously been shown to be effective in treatment of severe acute viral respiratory infections.Its research would require antibodies from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus infections or who have been vaccinated, once a vaccine has been developed.""By transferring the antibodies to a new patient, it may help that person's immune system respond to the infection and increase their chance of recovery,"" Takeda said in a statement.It is also studying whether its currently marketed or pipeline products might be effective treatments for infected patients, the company said, adding those efforts were at an early stage.Takeda joins other drugmakers working on developing drugs to treat the flu-like disease which has struck more than 90,000 people worldwide.US-based Gilead Sciences Inc said last week it had started two late-stage studies to test its drug, remdesivir, in patients with severe and moderate cases of the illness.Pfizer Inc said on Monday it had identified certain antiviral compounds it has in development that have the potential to inhibit coronaviruses and is engaging with a third party to screen the compounds.Takeda said it would share its plans with members of the US Congress on Wednesday and was in talks with various health and regulatory agencies and healthcare partners in the United States, Asia and Europe to move forward its research into the drug.The announcement comes amid news the US Congress could debate and pass as early as this week emergency funding, possibly in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion, to help battle the virus and aid businesses.Prior to Takeda's announcement, shares in the company, Japan's biggest pharmaceuticals firm by market value, closed down 0.95%."

250,Karnataka government forms rapid response teams to contain coronavirus,"BENGALURU :Karnataka has formed a rapid response team and taken several other measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, in the state, medical education minister K.Sudhakar said. ""A state nodal team and rapid response team have been formed,"" Sudhakar said on Wednesday in the state assembly.The move comes a day after a person working in Bengaluru's tech corridor was put under observation for coming in contact with a patient who has tested positive for the virus.Health authorities will now screen every passenger arriving at the two main airports in the state-- Bengaluru and Mangaluru --as well as other points of entry, including ports, Sudhakar added.He said international passengers arriving from any of the 11 most affected counties will be tested for the virus and will be advised self-quarantine.The chief secretary and senior officials from the medical health department will hold daily review meetings and will be in constant touch with central authorities.Though unverified news of companies asking their employees to work from home flew thick and fast, few companies have actually made such offers.""We’re monitoring the coronavirus situation closely and working to ensure that our employees have the information and resources they need to stay safe and informed. In India, we have implemented precautionary measures such as travel and event restrictions, visitor screenings at all our offices, increased frequency of office sanitization, and work-from-home provisions,"" Intel India said in a statement on Wednesday.However, a company employee claims an email confirming the developments was received but it did not ask people to work from home.The Karnataka Health and Family Welfare department on Tuesday had said that it was in touch with most IT companies and has issued workplace guidelines and travel advisories.The Intel employee who is now quarantined has been admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases.""He is fit and healthy and his test reports should come in later today,"" said a medical official, who inspected and interacted with residents of the area where the patient and his roommate lived, adding that there was nothing to panic about.The department has so far cleared around 201 people who have completed the 28-day quarantine period and around 284 remain in home isolation, according to health department officials.A total of around 60,000 people have been screened in the two international airports in Karnataka and around 4,500 people in the two major ports, officials added."
251,SC lifts RBI crypto ban: What this means for investors,"The Supreme Court today, struck down a ban imposed by the RBI on banks from allowing their systems to be used for cryptocurrency related payments in April 2018. The RBI ban applied only to the use of banking channels for crypto transactions and thus individuals continued to trade in cryptocurrencies using peer-to-peer networks, even after the ban. Trading between cryptocurrencies (without use of rupee payments for settlement), also continued. However the Supreme Court judgment may pave the way for revival of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an asset class by reopening up the formal financial system to it. A cryptocurrency can be defined broadly by two distinctive features. First, it is based on a distributed ledger meaning that records of its ownership are held across thousands of computers simultaneously, rather than any centralised system.Second, it is not issued by a centralised authority such as a central bank. For example, bitcoin is created by computers solving increasingly complex mathematical problems. This limits the supply of cryptocurrency rather than leaving it to the discretion of a central bank.The price of bitcoin, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies zoomed from a few cents since its inception in 2009 to about USD 14,000 in December 2017, a spectacular rise in price matched by no other asset class. Interest in it among global and Indian investors soared as the price pushed upwards throughout 2017.However enforcement agencies in India grew worried about its potential to act as a store for illicit wealth. The RBI also repeatedly cautioned investors from buying bitcoin saying that it was not a recognised currency in India. The following year saw the price of bitcoin crash to roughly USD 3,700 in December 2018. Indian investors received a further shock in April 2018 when the RBI banned the use of banking system for crypto payments.A large number of crypto exchanges shut shop in India and many investors were left stranded with stores of bitcoin that they could not liquidate. Bitcoin has staged a recovery since its crash and currently trades at about USD 8800 ( ₹6.43 lakh per bitcoin). However in 2019, news reports appeared of a draconian government legislation on cryptocurrencies that criminalised trade and even mere possession of them. The law has so far not been formally introduced in Parliament, however.""The ruling is a historic one. Based on it, the government will have to revise its proposed legislation on cryptocurrency.  This ruling is going to give a much needed boost to the struggling crypto currency platforms and work towards changing India’s image in adopting new age transactions,"" said Rashmi Deshpande, Indirect Tax Partner at Khaitan & Co., a lawyer who represented one of the exchanges who initially challenged the RBI ban.Ajeet Khurana former Head of the BACC (Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee of the IAMAI) and former CEO of Zebpay sounded a note of caution, “The price of bitcoin has fallen a lot from its December 2017 peak, and this might discourage fresh investors at present.However traders who accounted for the bulk of the volume profit from volatility and are hence likely to come back in bigger numbers. People should note that the government had proposed draconian legislation criminalizing mere possession of cryptocurrency although it was never introduced in Parliament. Such a law could still kill the legitimate crypto market in India,"" he said.Financial planners have also cautioned investors from putting their money in cryptocurrencies. “Cryptos are still some way from being used in the mainstream as alternative currency so, if it’s not going to be used for real world transactions, you can’t assign a real value to it. As an investment, most people aren’t equipped to handle the volatility of equity which is backed by actual earnings, so handling the volatility that comes with cryptocurrency (in the past 9 months, Bitcoin is down by 20%) will be very difficult,"" said Nithin Sasikumar, co-founder, Investography.Investors should stay away from this asset due to its inherently speculative nature. Even those who are confident about cryptocurrency should wait until there is more regulatory clarity."
252,"Coronavirus is slower than flu but more dangerous, says WHO chief","NEW DELHI :The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads less efficiently than the influenza or flu virus. However, the WHO also noted that the illness caused by coronavirus is more severe than that of the flu. In a media release, WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted, ""coronavirus spreads less efficiently than flu, and transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, while in the case of influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission.""The WHO is relying on data compiled on the virus to obtain a clearer picture of the situation as it unfolds. The WHO chief observed, ""as we get more data, we are understanding this virus, and the disease it causes, more and more.""He added, ""this virus is not SARS, it's not MERS, and it's not influenza. It is a unique virus with unique characteristics. Both coronavirus and influenza cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. However, there are some important differences between coronavirus and influenza. Some countries are looking for cases of coronavirus using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases.""According to evidence collected from China, which WHO observed, 1% of the reported COVID-19 cases do not display symptoms, and the majority of such cases tend to develop symptoms within two days.A total of 90,893 cases of COVID-19 infections and 3110 deaths have been reported globally.As per data released by the WHO, China reported 129 cases over the past 24 hours, which is the lowest number of cases since January 20. Outside China, 1848 cases were reported from 48 countries, of which, 80% of cases are from just three countries - the Republic of Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Italy.Meanwhile, 12 new countries have reported their first cases, and there are now 21 countries with one case reported from each country. At least 122 countries have not reported any cases.""There are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics to cure the disease. It can be contained - which is why we must do everything we can to contain it. That's why WHO recommends a comprehensive approach,"" said Ghebreyesus."
253,Cabinet approves merger of  10 PSBs,"NEW DELHI :The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the consolidation of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four entities, a move aimed at having fewer but stronger lenders in India. “The amalgamation is being done so that customers are able to reap the benefit of larger banks being scaled up and more fund being available for credit,"" finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters. “Banks are fully on board and this will be effective from 1 April,"" Sitharaman said. “To a large extent, I am convinced that the banks are on course. They have no issues carrying forward with the merger activity…core interest for banking, customers have been kept in mind.""At present, India has 18 state-owned banks compared with 27 in 2017. After the merger, the number will further come down to 12.The finance ministry’s decision is in line with the National Democratic Alliance government’s push for consolidation of state-owned banks, which it believes will not only lead to economies of scale, but also make lenders stronger, more competitive, and improve their risk-taking appetite.Last August, the finance ministry had announced the consolidation of 10 public sector lenders. Punjab National Bank (PNB), Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and United Bank will be brought together to form the second largest public sector bank in the country, after State Bank of India (SBI).Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank will merge to become the fourth-largest public sector lender, while Union Bank of India will merge with Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank to build India’s fifth-largest lender. Indian Bank will merge with Allahabad Bank to make India’s seventh-largest PSB.“For existing customers of all the amalgamating banks, this will increase access to banking services by about 3,000 branches or more. In addition, customers will benefit through investments in technology-enabled smart banking, such as paperless tab-banking, faster loan processing, banking from home, and customer-need driven credit offers,"" a senior government official said, requesting anonymity.Businesses will benefit through increased lending capacity, with the regulatory ceiling for lending to individual borrowers increasing by more than  ₹1,500 crore to  ₹3,000 crore, he added.In April 2019, Bank of Baroda (BoB) became the country’s third largest lender after its merger with Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. In 2017, five associate banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank had merged with SBI. “We have definitely gone into the details of Bank of Baroda’s amalgamation, looked at what has been the outcome in the short span, with an intention of understanding if there was any lesson that needs to be learnt and what impact it (amalgamation) had on the performance,"" Sitharaman said."
254,"Coronavirus outbreak: Apple restricts employee travel to Italy, South Korea","Apple Inc. restricted employee travel to Italy and South Korea, after recently instating a similar policy for China, as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread. “We have instituted specific travel restrictions in a few countries including China, South Korea, and Italy,"" the company told employees in a memo that outlines its latest response to the Covid-19 outbreak.Employees are only allowed to travel to those regions for business-critical reasons and must get approval from a company vice president, Apple told staff in messages viewed by Bloomberg News.The memo sent Monday evening also outlined the company’s procedures for handling the outbreak, including the encouragement of virtual meetings.“There are many ways to continue to manage our ongoing meetings and activities through calls and video,"" Apple said in the email to workers. “If you do have travel planned, we suggest you work with your managers to consider delaying or canceling business travel which could be postponed or managed through virtual meetings.""Apple also said “deep cleaning protocols are our top priority"" and are in effect across its stores, offices and employee shuttles. It has since put hand sanitizer stations at the front of its stores as well.The company’s memo also said that “any employee who is sick, in particular, anyone who has a fever or severe cough, should take sick leave until they have fully recovered."" It also is encouraging workers to wash their hands, not touch their faces and cover their coughs.Apple previously cut employee travel to China, the epicenter of the virus, and was forced to close all 42 of its local stores and offices. The company’s offices and more than half of its stores in the country have since re-opened.The move to cut travel to Italy and South Korea comes after the number of virus cases in those countries rapidly increased. Apple has one store in South Korea and 17 in Italy, but none of those stores have closed, according to a review of Apple’s retail website.On Friday, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the Cupertino, California-based company has suppliers and business operations in Korea and Italy. “It’s very important to see what happens there,"" he said.Apple has uniquely been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak due to the majority of its supply chain being based in China.

266,The coronavirus ‘stimulus’,"The Federal Reserve has become the default doctor for whatever ails the U.S. economy, and on Tuesday the financial physician applied what it hopes will be monetary balm for the economic damage from the coronavirus. Financial markets were underwhelmed after the big rally on Monday, which may speak to the limited effect that lower interest rates can have on the supply shock of a pandemic. The unanimous decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to cut the fed funds rate by 50 basis points to 1%-1.25% was at least bold. Perhaps more significant, the Fed also cut the rate it pays on excess reserves that banks park at the central bank by 50 basis points to 1.1%. This gives banks more of an incentive to put reserves to work in the real economy.The theory behind the rate cut appears to be that aggressive action is the best way to send a strong message of economic insurance. Perhaps this will help consumers—whose spending has kept the economy growing despite weak business investment—maintain confidence in the expansion. Other central banks are also likely to follow the Fed’s lead.Will this make much of an economic difference? Count us skeptical. Financial conditions weren’t tight even with a flight to the safety of U.S. Treasurys. The fall in the 10-year note to a historic low of 1% and the recent correction in stocks reflect the expectations of slower growth and thus lower corporate earnings.But this relates mainly to the damage to global supply chains and expected limits on travel and commerce as the world tries to mitigate the rates of infection. Nobody is going to take that flight to Tokyo because the Fed is suddenly paying less on excess reserves.The other concern is whether the Fed will have the nerve to raise rates again if the pandemic damage turns out to be less than feared. That won’t be easy in an election year, and November is still eight months away. President Trump on Tuesday tweeted a demand that the Fed do more even after its 50-point cut.The Fed’s great mistake after 9/11 was that it kept rates at or near 1% for far too long even after the 2003 tax cut had the economy humming. The seeds of the housing boom and bust were sown. The housing market has begun to take off again in recent months, and in the near term that will help cushion the economy during the coronavirus panic. The trick will be not letting it get carried away into another national price spiral.This being an election year, the political class is also starting to demand more fiscal “stimulus."" Mr. Trump tweeted approval for a payroll-tax cut for workers, while Elizabeth Warren bid higher, as she always does, for a $400 billion spending bill. It’s only a matter of time before Bernie Sanders raises her, and we start hearing about the fabled “Keynesian multiplier"" when $1 in new spending yields $1.70 in economic benefit. If Mr. Trump falls for that, he’d be embracing Joe Bidenomics.We tried the temporary payroll-tax cut idea in the slow growth Obama era, reducing the worker portion of the levy to 4.2% from 6.2% of salary. It took effect in January 2011, but the unemployment rate stayed above 9% for most of the rest of that year.Temporary tax cuts put more money in peoples’ pockets and can give a short-term lift to the GDP statistics. But the growth effect quickly vanishes because it doesn’t permanently change the incentive to save and invest. Workers understand their financial circumstances haven’t fundamentally changed and act accordingly.The main redeeming quality of a payroll-tax cut is that it isn’t new spending and might offer a refuge for politicians who feel they need to “do something"" in an election year. But unless it is permanent, it won’t be a stimulus for the economy—and probably not for the election.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."

Last year, Saif Alia Khan’s action drama Laal Kaptaan, was shot in the blazing deserts of Rajasthan, in the interiors of the state.“Audiences have really evolved over the past few years, they have gotten very smart so the minute they realize something is artificial, the identification factor goes away and that affects the movie,"" said Ram Mirchandani, president, motion pictures, Eros International Media Ltd, producers of Haathi Mere Saathi. The idea with the film, Mirchandani said, was to try and attain the visual and emotional quality of an Indian Jungle Book. Eros has shot the film in multiple locations including the Krabi Private National Park and the Ao Nang Safari Park in Thailand, and several forested areas like the Nalmukh Forest Reserve and the Santhanpara Forests in Kerala. The latter required a three-and-a-half hour drive from the hotel to the base location followed by another hour-and-a-half hour journey that could only be undertaken by jeep or on horses.“Of course you always have the option of shooting in front of a green screen but the emotions would still seem mechanical. The idea is to present a large canvas to the audience with real locations and make it look like an experience made for the big screen,"" said film trade and exhibition expert Girish Johar. It is getting increasingly difficult to get people to come to theatres, Johar added, with the advent of video streaming platforms and entertainment available at the click of a button.“So you have to do it either through music, or visuals or storyline. Though we can’t compete with Hollywood when it comes to budgets and scale,"" Johar said.Films like Haathi Mere Saathi inevitably entail much hardship along with shooting in real locations. While costs escalate to anywhere around or above Rs. 100 crore with a team of 300-350 people camping somewhere like a mini-city, the shooting schedule requires several government approvals besides combating tough climatic conditions, more often than not.“Yes, it is expensive and heavy work but let’s also look at the kind of visual experience we are bringing in,"" Mirchandani said."

The news comes just two days after a software employee from Hyderabad, who works in Bengaluru, was also found to be infected with the virus and was admitted at the state-run Gandhi hospital in Telangana’s capital.“We would like to inform you that one of our DSM colleagues in our Hyderabad office at Mindspace building has been diagnosed with Coronavirus (Covid-19).

282,"Coronavirus: Remote meetings, events - the way for businesses during pandemics","MUMBAI: Businesses are increasingly shifting their work meetings and events online in the aftermath of the alarming spread of COVID-19, more commonly known as novel coronavirus. Since late January, when parts of China were put under a lockdown, businesses have started turning towards remote work modules and now with cases detected in India, more and more companies are asking employees to work from home while webcasting crucial events.In fact, many global events that were cancelled over the past week have now been shifted to virtual mode.Google's Cloud Next conference which was scheduled for 6-8 April has now moved registrations for the digital event. “We are working on delivering a number of virtual engagement opportunities for press to meet with top Google Cloud executives, customers and partners while minimizing travel.

283,Coronavirus delivers jolt to sleepy currency markets,"The coronavirus epidemic has delivered a jolt to previously sleepy foreign-exchange markets. Currency trading had mostly been calm in recent years, as a degree of certainty about the outlook for U.S. interest rates and other factors, such as the low cost of insurance against major foreign-exchange moves, suppressed volatility.The fast-spreading virus has interrupted that equability. The Cboe/CME FX Euro Volatility Index, a measure of expected turbulence in the dollar-euro futures market derived from options prices, has surged 21% over the past week, extending this year’s advance to 44%.The Cboe gauge of implied volatility in the dollar-yen futures market has risen even further, jumping 72% in 2020. Japan’s yen has moved up or down an average of 0.44% against the dollar in the spot market since the start of February, according to FactSet, almost double the average daily swing of 0.24% that took place in the preceding 12 months.One reason why volatility has returned: The epidemic led investors to predict that the Federal Reserve would shift course and lower borrowing costs, instead of maintaining rates at current levels. They were proved right Tuesday when it cut its target interest rate by half a percentage point—the first rate reduction to take place between scheduled meetings since the financial crisis—to shield the economy from a potential downturn in global growth.This change of direction has upended bets that rates would remain significantly higher in the U.S. than in other major economies.The gap between expected borrowing costs in different economies often, though not always, dictates moves in currency markets because money managers typically seek to invest where they think they can earn the greatest returns.“One of the drivers of low volatility was the expectation of interest rates from central banks to be on hold for the foreseeable future,"" said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura. “Now we have the potential for central-bank rate cuts, predominantly from the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and this would narrow the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and its partners.""As the threat of a pandemic began to loom last week, stock markets reeled and economists slashed their forecasts for global growth in 2020.The Bank of Japan, Bank of England and European Central Bank have all said they stand ready to tackle the economic and financial impact of the coronavirus. The Fed has more room to reduce borrowing costs because it currently targets a higher rate of interest than policy makers in Japan, the eurozone and the U.K.Finance ministers and central-bank governors from the Group of Seven countries said Tuesday they were prepared to cooperate to guard against economic risks stemming from the epidemic, though they stopped short of stating specific actions.With less certainty about the gap between rates set by different central banks, option sellers have pushed up the price of insuring against currency moves, Mr. Rochester said. In turn, that has boosted the level of implied volatility.Currency swings have also become more pronounced in emerging markets, many of which are closely tied to China’s economy through commodity exports and supply chains. Implied volatility for a basket of emerging-market currencies has risen 26% in 2020, according to an index calculated by JPMorgan Chase & Co.South Africa’s rand, one of the worst-performing currencies this year, has gained or lost an average of 0.85% against the dollar since the start of February, compared with an average daily move of 0.61% in the prior 12 months.Still, currencies remain calmer than stocks. The Cboe Volatility Index, a gauge of expected turbulence in large-cap U.S. equities, has surged 135% in 2020 and the S&P 500 followed up its worst week since the financial crisis with its best day in more than a year on Monday.Although the epidemic has raised the prospect of changes to monetary policy, many investors expect central banks to act in tandem. This “herding"" accounts for around two-thirds of the undershoot in currency volatility, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.“We wouldn’t count on a return to 2016-levels of foreign-exchange instability as central banks gear up for another round of easing,"" they said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."

Services PMI rose for the fifth consecutive month to 57.5 in February after dipping to a 19-month low last September, according to the survey by data analytics firm IHS Markit.A figure of above 50 indicates expansion, while a sub-50 print signals contraction.The February data showed that robust increase in both manufacturing and services output pushed growth of private sector business activity to an eight-year high.

The data also showed that service providers experienced a marked improvement in workforce productivity, with the sharp rise in business activity happening despite a softer and only modest increase in employment,"" Pollyanna de Lima, principal economist, IHS Markit, said.“Both manufacturing and services PMI suggest that growth is recovering rapidly, but this momentum is heading towards possible Covid-19 impact in the future both from supply angle (China) and demand (spread in the West and India),"" said Prithviraj Srinivas, economist, Axis Capital."

When SBI Cards lists on the exchanges later this month, it will become the only listed company in India in this space.FinancialsSBI Cards has two major revenue streams: Non-interest income (primarily comprised of fee-based income such as interchange fees, late fees and annual fees, among others) and interest income on the receivables when cardholders cannot pay their dues on time. In FY19, interest income was 52% of the total revenue while non-interest income was 48% of the total pie.Revenue and profit have more than doubled over the past three years. Net profit rose to  ₹862 crore in fiscal 2019 from  ₹372 crore in fiscal 2017 while revenues from operations increased to  ₹6,999 crore in fiscal 2019 from  ₹3,346 crore in fiscal 2017.What Analysts Say""We believe that SBI Cards is well positioned for continued growth given its strong market position with diverse product offerings, healthy financials, stable asset quality and sustained support from promoter SBI. At upper price band of  ₹755, the IPO is priced at 13.5 times post issue FY20 book value and 45.8 times post issue FY20 EPS (annualised).

The brokerage has a subscribe rating on the issue.Santosh Meena, senior analyst at TradingBells, expects SBI Cards IPO to be successful both in terms of subscriptions and listing gain.""India is under-penetrated in terms of credit card market and the government has a focus on digital transactions. SBI Cards also has the strong parentage of SBI, which provides access to its extensive branch network,"" he said, adding that a listing gain of more than 50% could be expected.Other domestic brokerages Angel Broking and Motilal Oswal have also given a subscribe rating on SBI Cards IPO.""Being the first in the segment to get listed, it could generate high investor interest,"" said Motilal Oswal, adding that given its dominant position in the credit card market and strong parentage, SBI Cards is well placed to benefit from the rising trend of digital payments and e-commerce.Angel Broking says that though valuations are a bit on the higher side, ""we are positive on the future outlook of the company given favorable industry scenario, large untapped SBI customers and strong financial track record.""Risk FactorsSBI Cards faces competition from new-age fintech led payment modes like Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and mobile wallets. Slower economic growth can result in rising NPAs. Also, currently interchange fees for credit cards or interest rates charged by credit card companies are not regulated. Any move to regulate these could have an impact."

291,The geography of riots in India,"The horrific riots in Delhi last week raise an important question: are economics and demographics responsible? Jafrabad and Chandbagh, which witnessed the greatest violence, are home to a significant population of young men. These are also relatively poorer areas of Delhi. A Mint analysis of district-level National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data suggests that there is no strong link between demographics and riots nationally. There is no link between poverty and riots either.In the case of most districts, the police districts in the country are the same as the administrative districts. In other cases, either police (NCRB) districts have been combined to match a census district (Tirupati and Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh have been combined as Chittoor, for instance) or census districts have been combined to match a large police district (Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban districts have been clubbed together to map it onto the Greater Mumbai police district, for instance) for this analysis.In 2017-18, riots in India, depending on the measure used, were concentrated in parts of Kerala, Haryana, Bihar, Tripura, and the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, the analysis shows.To capture all rioting-related offences across India, the NCRB compiles data broadly categorized as offences against public tranquillity. This includes not just rioting as defined by the Indian Penal Code (IPC) but other forms of agitation such as unlawful assembly and promoting enmity among groups. Since state police forces may not be consistent in defining riots, this overall figure remains the best measure of rioting-related offences in India. In 2018, the latest year for which data is available, there were 76,851 such offences across India - a slight decrease from the previous year. When adjusting for a population (based on population projections), this works out to 5.7 riot offences per 100,000 people.At the district-level, though, riot rates vary significantly. To account for annual volatility, we calculate the average riot rate for 2017 and 2018 (riot data from earlier years are not comparable). During 2017-18, the average riot rate was the highest in Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu (68 riots per 100,000 people) and Shopian in Kashmir(41).27 districts, largely in the North-East, had no cases of riots registered during these two years. At the state-level, Kerala (20.4) and Haryana (12.8) had the highest average riots rates while Punjab and Mizoram had the lowest riot rates.Average riot rates, though, could simply reflect better reporting of crimes. Some states tend to have higher rates for all crimes simply because their state police forces are more proactive when registering cases.One way to adjust for this is to examine the number of riots as a share of all crimes registered in a district. A higher share of riots would suggest that riots are a more common occurrence. Using this measure, the pattern changes slightly.States with higher average riot rates tend to also have a greater share of riots. But the inter-state differences are less stark if we apply this measure to examine the intensity of riots. In Kerala, for instance, 3.3% of all crimes in 2017-18 were riot-related offences. This was above the all-India average (2.6%) but below that of Tripura (6.7%), Jammu and Kashmir (6.3%), and Bihar (6.3%).Source: NCRB One commonly held perception is that poor and young men are most prone to violence. North East Delhi, where the riots happened, is the poorest of the districts in Delhi (according to the multi-dimensional poverty index). It has the greatest proportion of young men and the highest share of Muslims among all Delhi districts.It is unclear to what extent these factors contributed to last week’s riots. But at the national level these factors do not appear to have any link with rioting. Across districts, riots do not seem to be associated with greater poverty or younger male populations (share of 18-35 year-olds)."
292,Red Label breaks transgender stereotypes in new campaign,"NEW DELHI: Known for inclusive advertising, Hindustan Unilever-owned tea brand Brooke Bond Red Label is back with a new campaign around the transgender community. Through its long-running Swad Apnepan Ka campaign, Brooke Bond Red Label's new ad spot highlights the prejudice faced by transgenders and shows how a cup of tea helps overcome prejudice. Created by advertising agency Ogilvy India, the heartwarming film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYwmoiCUZPE features a visibly irritated grandmother with her young granddaughter stuck at a traffic jam on a rainy day. Her attention is diverted as a transgender knocks on the cab’s window pane. She opens the window to handover money but to her surprise the transgender offers her a steaming cup of tea from her tea stall. Overwhelmed by the thoughtful gesture, the grandmother ends up offering blessings.“Under this long running campaign, we have told many heart-warming stories of how a tasty cup of Brooke Bond Red Label tea helps people find common ground, irrespective of any differences that they may have. This particular story highlights how tea turns prejudice into acceptance. We have all been guilty of letting stereotypes come in the way of a more inclusive society,"" said Shiva Krishnamurthy, vice-president, tea and foods, Hindustan Unilever Limited.The campaign is being promoted across television and digital platforms. Brooke Bond Red Label has been weaving socially relevant advertising since 2014 when its 'Neighbour' ad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQuddKFhfFA was released which touched upon an oft-repeated yet sensitive theme—the Hindu-Muslim divide in India.However, the biggest gamble as well as an equally rewarding decision by the brand was creating a campaign on transgender community. Its Six Pack Band video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blvOBnSRfVc released in 2016 on India’s first transgender band, not only stood out for its theme of inclusivity but also managed to bag the highest creative recognition in the ad world, the Cannes Grand Prix last year.Kainaz Karmakar and Harshad Rajadhyaksha, chief creative officers, Ogilvy India, said when one works on the same core idea, year after year, the work can get jaded.“So you have to be harder on yourself. You have to make sure the story is powerful, relevant and executed beautifully. For the current campaign, the client brief was, most of us believe we are socially evolved but when confronted with some situations, we regress to making judgment too quickly. One such instance is, when we come face to face with a transgender. All our conditioning kicks in, even before we have said ‘hello’. With this in mind, we started writing stories,"" they added"
293,NBFCs in India face their biggest funding test yet,"India’s troubled shadow banks face their biggest test yet in the months ahead: a record bill to settle in the local debt market. The lenders will need to repay $15.1 billion of local-currency bonds in the three months starting April 1, the most ever for a quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That will prove challenging for the lower-rated ones among them, given they’ve been largely shut out of the domestic funding market.While India’s credit crisis is showing some signs of easing with borrowing costs dropping for top-rated non-bank financing companies, defaults remain a risk for weaker firms. More missed payments could undermine the Indian administration’s efforts to boost credit in an economy set to grow at its slowest pace in more than a decade.Shadow banks are recovering from a prolonged cash crunch that began in 2018 with defaults at the IL&FS Group. They have been a key source of funding for everyone from India’s smaller businesses to its tycoons as the nation’s banking system battles the world’s worst bad loan ratios.The top five Indian companies with the highest amount of rupee notes falling due in the next quarter owe 546 billion rupees to investors, or about half of the total amounts due, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Housing Development Finance Corp., India’s biggest mortgage lender, has the largest rupee bond redemptions among local firms maturing in the April-June period, the data show.In a sign that investors may be growing more concerned about the sector again, average yields on 10-year top-rated rupee shadow bank bonds rose 3 basis points to 7.41% Tuesday, the most in almost two weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They tumbled 56 basis points in February.Rajat Bahl, chief ratings officer at Brickwork Ratings in Mumbai, said he doesn’t expect any “credit mishaps"" in the sector next quarter because liquidity conditions are easing gradually for larger firms with banks starting to lend to them. Shadow banks also have a back-stop in the form of the government’s plan to partially guarantee financing to them, he said.Even so, the ability of weaker shadow banks to service debt remains a risk, Bahl said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

298,"SC allows cryptocurrency trading, quashes RBI ban","NEW DELHI :The Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted the ban imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on virtual currency trading, including cryptocurrencies. The three-judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton Nariman quashed the central bank’s order while hearing petitions challenging the April 2018 circular imposing the ban on financial service providers. The bench, also comprising Justices S. Ravindra Bhat and V. Ramasubramanian, allowed the petition on the “ground of proportionality"".“When the consistent stand of RBI is that they have not banned virtual currencies and when the government of India is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up with several proposals, including two draft bills, both of which advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate,"" said the top court.The circular issued by the central bank in July 2018 said that entities regulated by RBI are prohibited from “providing any service in relation to virtual currencies, including those of transfer or receipt of money in accounts relating to the purchase or sale of virtual currencies"". However, it had not banned virtual currencies.“RBI’s regulatory powers are wide and with the benefit of the Supreme Court’s judgment it is expected that it will reconsider its approach to cryptocurrency and come up with a new, calibrated framework or regulation that deals with the reality of these technological advancements, given that central banks across the world are issuing their own cryptocurrencies,"" said L. Viswanathan, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.The Centre is yet to implement a regulation or put in place a monitoring mechanism on virtual currencies. Last July, an inter-ministerial panel set up by the government on virtual currencies had proposed banning of private cryptocurrencies, barring any digital currency issued by the government by enacting a law and imposing fines and penalties, including jail-term, for trading in cryptocurrency.The panel comprising officials from the finance ministry’s department of economic affairs, the ministry of information technology, and RBI finalized a report and a draft bill, Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, on virtual currencies. However, it is yet to be implemented. “It is yet to be seen how lawmakers and the government go ahead and adopt a legal framework for regulating the trade of cryptocurrencies in India.The biggest challenges attached to dealing in cryptocurrencies that requires regulation are anonymity of transactions and volatility and fluctuation of the value of cryptocurrencies,"" said Tanuj Hazari, advocate, KNM and Partners Law Offices. “I think what’s likely to happen now is that (Indian cryptocurrency) exchanges, which had shut down after the RBI’s order, will reopen,"" said Vishal Gupta, founder of crypto-based startups, SearchTrade and Binex.japnam.b@livemint.comPrasid Banerjee contributed to this story."

301,Why now is the right time to invest in Bajaj Finance FD,"A traditionally popular investment avenue, the fixed deposit continues to prove its mettle even today, guaranteeing generous returns in an underperforming economy. In a move to stop the decrease in credit growth, which now stands at a low 7%, the Reserve Bank of India has announced long-term repo operations (LTRO). With this instrument, the RBI aims to lend up to Rs.1 trillion to banks at the policy repo rate of 5.15% for a period of one and three years. While this will boost borrowing, banks are likely to reduce the interest rate of deposits. In addition, the returns offered by small saving schemes like PPF and NSC may also reduce post March 2020. Rising inflation as well as experts warning investors to be careful of defaults in the FD sphere, especially when it comes to small finance banks, should encourage you to seek returns that both beat inflation and mitigate risk. This makes it an opportune time to invest in Fixed Deposit offering high returns with trusted issuers like Bajaj Finance. Being the only Indian NBFC to have a credit rating of ‘BBB-’ from S&P Global, Bajaj Finance assures the safety of your investment. Moreover, even in such times, Bajaj Finance offers an interest rate up to 8.35%.Read on to know why you should invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit now.Stable returns in volatile conditionsWith the overall economic slowdown, global trade war and the general loss of the investor’s trust, the current market conditions aren’t all that inviting. However, even in such conditions, Bajaj Finance ensures generous returns that will help you meet your long- and short-term financial goals while combating inflation.Here, senior citizen investors get handsome FD interest rates of up to 8.35%, while banks across the nation slash rates to new lows. As a new customer, you can earn up to 8.10% interest, while as an existing customer, you can earn up to 8.20% interest on your investment. Remember that you avail these returns only on choosing a tenure of more than 3 years and opting for payout on maturity. This rate of return is also encouraging keeping in mind that the RBI projects that CPI inflation rate will ease up to 3.2% by Q3 2020-21. This means investing now and earning nearly 5% over the projected CPI inflation rate will hold immense value for investors.To get a better idea of the interest payout and maturity amount earned by different customer profiles on investing Rs.20 lakh for a tenure of 48 months, see the table below.As a new customer, you can earn up to 8.10% interest, while as an existing customer, you can earn up to 8.20% interest on your investment. Diversify to avoid market-related risksAdding this FD to your portfolio ensures that even in volatile and underwhelming market conditions, you earn generous returns. This is especially pertinent given that LTRO is already in effect and leading banks have dropped their FD interest rates to as low as 5.50%. Further, as this an NBFC FD that has the highest stability ratings of FAAA and MAAA from CRISIL and ICRA respectively, the Bajaj Finance FD assures that your investments are in safe hands.Align your financial goals with your FD returnsWhile your other investments may not yield the expected returns due to the economic slowdown, FDs become the perfect medium to finance both your long-term and short-term goals. However, keep in mind that even though this FD is virtually risk-free, it is susceptible to rate cuts when the repo rate changes, which are expected in June 2020. So, investing in a Bajaj Finance FD now is crucial to lock in a corpus at the prevailing FD interest rates.What’s more, you can align your investment with your financial goals and still combat inflation. With help of the FD Calculator, you can identify the most efficient tenure and know exactly how much to expect at maturity. However, you should note that long-tenure investments result in higher returns and are generally the better option for wealth generation.The table below displays the interest payout a new customer earns from investing Rs.30 lakh in a Bajaj Finance FD over different tenures.investing in a Bajaj Finance FD now is crucial to lock in a corpus at the prevailing FD interest rates. Make smaller investments with the Systematic Deposit PlanGiven the unearthing of the PMC bank fraud causing losses in crores and the news of AAA-rated papers defaulting, you may be reluctant to invest all your savings at once. However, with the Systematic Deposit Plan, you don’t have to commit a large lump sum to grow your wealth. Here, you can make small monthly deposits of just Rs. 5,000 per month, at the prevailing interest rate. This helps you put money aside in an instrument that combats inflation and allows you build wealth slowly and steadily. With every deposit counted as a new FD, the tenure you chose for the first deposit will apply to all future deposits under this feature, which allows you to choose between 6 and 48 deposits.With such benefits at your fingertips, now is the time to start working towards profitable returns. Book a Bajaj Finance online FD by filling out a simple form and am executive will get in touch with you at the earliest.Disclaimer: This content is distributed by Bajaj Finserv.

302,Coronavirus: IMF-World Bank spring meet to be a virtual affair,"NEW DELHI: The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will shift the spring gathering of finance ministers and central bankers, to be held in Washington in April, to a ""virtual format"" following the alarming spread of COVID-19, also called the novel coronavirus, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank president David Malpass said in a joint statement late on Tuesday. “Like everyone else around the world, we have been deeply concerned by the evolving situation of the coronavirus and the human tragedy surrounding it. Given growing health concerns related to the virus, the Management of the IMF and World Bank Group and their Executive Boards have agreed to implement a joint plan to adapt the 2020 IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings to a virtual format,"" the joint statement said.The meeting was scheduled for 16-18 April.The IMF and World Bank hold their spring meetings in April and their annual meetings in October, where finance ministers and central bank governors discuss global economic and financial developments.The meetings are attended by thousands of officials, journalists and private sector participants from 180 member countries.""We remain fully committed to maintaining a productive dialogue with our stakeholders and will leverage our IT-related and virtual connection capabilities to the fullest to hold our essential policy consultations with the membership. We will also continue to share IMF and World Bank analyses. With this adapted format, we are confident that our member countries will be able to effectively engage on pressing global economic issues at these Spring Meetings,"" the lending agencies added.This is the latest in a series of cancellations or postponement of  major world events in recent past.The White House has postponed the ASEAN Summit in Las Vegas, which connects the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian nations, while India has decided to postpone its biggest maritime exercise, “Milan"", involving around 40 countries in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus infections across the world. Several major corporate events have also been cancelled or postponed because of the outbreak, including F8, Facebook's annual conference for developers and Adobe's annual live summit.The Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the biggest smartphone conference of the year, was canceled after biggies such as LG, Amazon, Sony, Ericsson, Facebook pulled out of the event because of the coronavirus outbreak.Since it was first reported in China's Wuhan in December, the virus has spread to 74 countries affecting 91,783 people globally, with death toll now at 3,123, according to information available on the World Health Organization (WHO).While most of these cases are in China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran have emerged as the new hotspots for the epidemic.South Korea now has 4,812 cases, the largest outside of China, closely followed by Iran with 2,336 affected by the virus. US has reported 64 cases, and India has confirmed six cases.WHO has stopped short of calling it a global pandemic but raised the global risk assessment of COVID-19 to ""very high""."

Kuo claimed that the mini-LED component market is still safe from the Covid-19 outbreak. Kuo, in his statement said, “The product research and development for mini LED remain unaffected by the COVID-19. The visibility for commercialization has even exceeded the expectations in our previous report.""Mini-LED screens provide relatively higher contrast ratios and wider colour gamut in comparison to LCD. The technology is not as advanced as Micro-LED but in comparison to traditional LCD, mini-LEDs will provide much darker blacks.He goes on to name the six products that are in the pipeline.

Apple will try to maintain a footprint similar to the outgoing MacBook Pro but still accommodate the 14.1-inch screen.The 16-inch MacBook Pro on the other hand is expected to get an all new display technology in comparison to the model launched in 2019.The analyst has not provided a solid timeline for the launches of the new devices but has claimed that the 27-inch iMac Pro will be launching in the fourth quarter of this year.

At 10.41 am, the currency was trading at 73.35 a dollar, down 0.06% from previous close. Earlier in the day, the rupee gained at 72.90 a dollar compared with Tuesday's close of 73.30.

If one goes by the latest reports, there are 21 confirmed cases in India.Global financial markets have been spooked by the spread of COVID-19, commonly referred to as novel coronavirus, triggering risk-off sentiment and flights to safe-haven assets. A 50-basis point cut in US interest rates overnight spurred a rally in other Asian currencies as well.Overnight, the US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in an emergency move since the 2008 financial crisis amid mounting concern that the coronavirus outbreak could stall the economic expansion.

305,Companies find ways to keep their annual reports from being a bore,"When German chemicals maker Covestro AG began drafting its 2019 annual report in August, executives opted for a change. Instead of producing a text-heavy report, the company decided to publish a digital version with video messages, interactive graphics and even a quiz. It wasn’t just the format of the annual report that changed—the purpose did too. Covestro turned what many companies view simply as a regulatory requirement into a resource for a broader audience to learn more about the company. “Behind our figures are emotional stories that we want to tell, regardless of time, place and device,"" said Thomas Toepfer, the company’s finance chief.For many companies, annual reports are no longer simply tomes of legalese, tables and footnotes. Executives increasingly are producing year-end summaries that allow for more reader engagement and easier consumption on mobile devices and computer screens.Annual reports for 2019 from FTSE 100 companies provided better explanations of their business, potential threats to their operations and how they created value for stakeholders compared with previous years, according to research released in January by U.K. consulting firm Radley Yeldar Ltd.“The trend in corporate reporting is toward providing a more complete picture of a company’s business model, performance and prospects,"" said Lisa French, chief technical officer at the International Integrated Reporting Council, a coalition of regulators, standard setters, investors, companies and other groups that focuses on corporate reporting.The evolution, which has been more pronounced in Europe than in other parts of the world, has been driven in part by changing regulation. The European Union, for example, enacted a nonfinancial reporting directive forcing large listed companies to report on social and environmental issues. The shift also stems from greater investor demand for granular details presented in a way that is easy to digest.British Land Co., for instance, has sought to produce a more readable annual report by eliminating jargon while still giving stakeholders information for a comprehensive understanding of the company.“We operate in an industry which can be very technical and has been prone to using technical industry language and lots of three-letter acronyms,"" said David Walker, head of investor relations at British Land, one of the U.K.’s biggest property real-estate investment trusts.In 2019, Mr. Walker and a team of about 10 spent half a year drafting, writing and revising the report, striving to use straightforward language while avoiding abbreviations such as ERV, short for estimated rental value. “We asked ourselves, ‘Is everybody familiar with ERV?’ Maybe not,"" he said. British Land now talks about “future rents"" to make things easier for readers.In the U.S., strict reporting requirements mean that public companies tend to stick to a more formal, text-heavy approach, lawyers and executives say. Companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission whose shareholders vote on the appointment of directors remain required to put out a printed version of the Form 10-K annual report and send it to shareholders in the mail.U.S.-listed companies also have steadily increased the number of words used in footnotes to better explain financials, according to Audit Analytics, a research firm that analyzes financial filings. The average number of words in footnotes per 10-K was 22,905 in 2019, up from 18,821 in 2014, Audit Analytics said.“There is little variance in Form 10-Ks filed by U.S. companies, and there hasn’t been a lot of innovation,"" said Anna Pinedo, a securities lawyer at law firm Mayer Brown LLP in New York.“U.S. companies could deviate a bit more from the formula, but that may make them [prone] to litigation.""The SEC recently proposed changes to rules governing how companies disclose financial information, shifting from strict guidance toward principles-based disclosures that aim to simplify information for companies and investors.Some U.S. companies have found ways to satisfy regulators while providing additional, nonfinancial information for investors. E-commerce marketplace Etsy Inc. last year integrated metrics about the wider environmental and societal impact of its business in its annual report. “It is a pretty coordinated storytelling exercise,"" said Rachel Glaser, Etsy’s finance chief.Vornado Realty Trust filed its audited sustainability report to the SEC, even though it isn’t a regulatory requirement. “We expect more companies to follow the example,"" said Joseph Macnow, the company’s finance chief. The fact that the SEC doesn’t prescribe a certain format for companies’ reporting on sustainability gives Vornado more flexibility to go beyond the numbers, he said.That approach is welcomed by investors who want to dig deeper into a company.“Every [material piece of] information, on top of what’s required from a regulatory perspective, is useful for me as an investor,"" said Robert-Jan Boudewijn, a portfolio manager at APG Groep NV, a Dutch pension fund management firm.The annual report overhaul at Covestro appears to have led to more engagement with investors, Mr. Toepfer said. Page views were up, the number of comments rose and the company got more mentions in social networks, he said.The cherry on top: Covestro saved some money—around €30,000 ($33,411)—by switching to a digital report, Mr. Toepfer said. The company only printed 200 annual reports, down from several thousand in years prior.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."
306,How corporate executives in Noida got honey-trapped on gay dating app,"NOIDA :The five robbers arrested by the Noida police a day before had allegedly looted several people they met through a dating application for gays, officials said on Tuesday. The accused would chat with gullible targets on the app and set up a meeting and then rob them of their valuables, including jewellery or cash, the officials said. The five were also allegedly involved in several cases of loot and robberies, a senior officer said.The five accused, all natives of neighbouring Bulandshahr district, were travelling in a stolen car when they were held by the officers from the Phase 3 police station after an encounter in which two of them had suffered bullet injuries, according to police.Those held were identified as Kapil Sharma, Rahul Saini, Ajay Sharma, Rajkumar, alias Raj Sharma, and Manish.While an FIR was registered against them in which a man claimed he was forced by the accused to withdraw money from an ATM after the gang lured him to a personal meeting over the app.""The gang has been involved both in direct robberies as well as those done via the app, wherein they targeted gay people looking for a match. There could be over a dozen such people who have been robbed or duped by them but many have not come out to file complaints,"" DCP (Central) Noida Harish Chander said. ""After getting into chat with people on the app, the accused either sought a meeting at their place of choice or the target's place or even some third place. Once meeting personally, they would rob the target and flee,"" Chander said.After their arrest on Monday, the gang led to the recovery of stolen jewellery worth  ₹30 lakh and two stolen cars,  ₹1.14 lakh in cash, 24 wrist watches, among others, police said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

307,RBI chief Shaktikanta Das sees rate cut as option as coronavirus threat grows,"Reserve Bank of India governor said he’s ready to act to shield the economy from the coronavirus and reiterated there’s room to cut interest rates if needed. Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg News in Mumbai hours before the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in an emergency move, Shaktikanta Das said “there is a strong reason for coordinated policy action."" For India, options include a rate cut and supporting the market through liquidity measures, he said.Inflation, which had kept the central bank from easing since December, is expected to moderate, he said in an interview at the RBI’s headquarters on Tuesday. He argued the bank’s flexible inflation-targeting framework allows the central bank to look through recent price pressures and loosen policy.“We’re ready for a response should the situation warrant,"" Das said in a meeting room decorated with framed portraits of his predecessors. “And going forward, in the near future, I do expect some discussion through video conference or telephone conference among the central banks of the large economies, including India.""The Fed’s action and the governor’s comments meant the RBI could front-load its future rate cuts, said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Edelweiss Securities Pvt. in Mumbai. That’s besides boosting cash injections through long-term repo operations, she said.Australia and Malaysia also lowered interest rates on Tuesday, while Indonesia said its working on a second stimulus package. Monetary authorities in Japan and the U.K. pledged action to stabilize markets -- a throwback to the coordinated action in the aftermath of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.“We, G-7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, are closely monitoring the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its impact on markets and economic conditions,"" the G-7’s finance ministers and central bankers said Tuesday in a statement published after Das spoke with Bloomberg News.“There is definitely a strong reason for coordinated policy action, because coronavirus has now turned out to be a global problem,"" Das said. “So when the problem is global, naturally the response and the need for coordinated action is so much more.""India’s sovereign bonds rallied, with the 10-year yield dropping seven basis points to 6.27% at 9:05 a.m. on Wednesday.Das also addressed lingering concerns about the nation’s shadow banks, saying only about four firms required active monitoring now and the sector no longer posed a risk to financial stability.These non-bank finance companies have less “interconnectivity with other entities"" such as banks and mutual funds, Das said. “Bank funding to the NBFC sector has shown very good improvement. The liquidity situation has improved.""The RBI cut interest rates five times in 2019 to support an economy headed for its weakest expansion in 11 years, but has been on pause since December following a spike in inflation, which accelerated again to 7.6% in January - well above the central bank’s 2%-6% target. Data on Friday showed growth decelerated to 4.7% in the three months through December from a year ago, the third straight quarterly slowdown.Despite the RBI lowering borrowing costs, loan growth has slowed to a more than two-year low in February. That’s partly because banks have been cautious about lending as they grapple with the world’s steepest bad-loan ratio, and in part due to companies holding back investments amid waning consumer demand in an economy that’s set for its weakest expansion in 11 years.Das said the virus’s impact on India will come through two channels: trade with China and weaker global growth. The RBI would be able to quantify the hit to growth at its next policy meeting in April, he said.With only five confirmed coronavirus cases as of March 2, India has been relatively insulated from the outbreak. However, the economy probably won’t be, since India depends on China for more than one-fifth of its total non-oil, non-gold goods imports.Indian businesses aren’t currently facing any problem in securing supplies of raw materials, but there may be issues if the shutdowns in China continue for longer, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week. The government is ready to respond with measures, she had said separately.“Everyone likes a rate cut,"" Das said when asked if a coordinated response from global peers would lead to market pressure on him to also move. “We will do what we think is right.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

308,"Federal Reserve’s rate cut just a painkiller, demand shock worries remain","The US Federal Reserve’s emergency move of cutting interest rate by a sharp 50 basis points has done little to infuse confidence among investors. Global markets may still be staring at a huge slowdown in the economy. This is the eighth time in the last two decades that Fed has cut rates by 50 basis points in one go, suggesting that the impact of Covid-19 is much more acute than what was estimated earlier by the markets. The rate cut, interestingly, has sent global equity markets into a tailspin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index of the US tumbled 2.94% on Tuesday, while the Nifty 50 also corrected by 0.46% on Wednesday. Asian markets also remained weak.While the rate cuts are explicable, whether this will lead to a revival in growth is clearly in question. Market experts are pointing out that the latest rate cut may not suffice as it will only just be lowering borrowing costs.Graphic by Santosh Sharma/Mint  The bigger problem the global economy faces right now is demand contraction due to travel restrictions in wake of the spread of the coronavirus worldwide and supply chain disruptions. The concern now is that the change in behaviour towards the virus outbreak could lead to a demand shock and that cannot be addressed just by rate cuts.Besides, the slowdown could get acute if the epidemic gets worse. “We see a 50 basis points risk to H120 growth if the coronavirus infection worsens. As it is, we see FY20 growth at 4.9% and FY21 at 5.6%,"" noted BofA (Bank of America) Securities in a note.Besides, Fed’s actions to keep the liquidity taps flowing will eventually find its way to risk assets. “The rate cut will boost easy money for institutions, which will find its way to capital markets. This will help stabilise equity markets across the globe and find its way into the equity of new businesses through private equity and FDI route,"" said a chief investment officer of a leading fund house on condition of anonymity.The markets could, however, remain jittery for some time as it is currently difficult to quantify the damage the epidemic would inflict on economies. Even gold, a safe haven asset, is gyrating wildly. Global institutions could also reassess their risks from Covid-19 and reorganize their portfolios.“The dynamics of the global economies could change permanently once the full impact is known, which means that allocation to risk assets could also undergo a huge shift with certain sectors being preferred over others,"" noted the fund manager.Risk assets are being repriced. The Nifty 50 index has lost more than 1,000 points from its highs on 20 January 2020, with FY21 price-earnings multiple down to about 17.5 times. Uncertainties around big events have never been easy to estimate as different risk assets will behave differently. As the final outcome is not yet known, the markets could stay on the edge for a longer time till the dust settles."
309,Antony Waste IPO gets mixed reviews as SBI Cards overshadows buzz,"MUMBAI: Antony Waste Handling Company Ltd (AWHCL) looks to raise  ₹206 crore from investors in a book-built IPO which opened on Wednesday. But the IPO seems to be missing the buzz and the frenzy that SBI Cards IPO managed to generate in the last few days. The company has set the price band of the IPO in the range of  ₹295-300 per equity share.AWHCL has allocated to anchor investors which include Massachusetts Institute of Technology which is subscribing 65.6% of its anchor book, while Vantage Equity Fund (18%) and 238 Plan Associates LLC (16.4%) will take up the rest.The issue comprises an offer for sale (OFS) of 57 lakh shares by Tonbridge (Mauritius) Ltd, Leeds (Mauritius) Ltd, Cambrid (Mauritius) Ltd and Guilford (Mauritius) Ltd. The issue also constitutes a fresh issue of  ₹35 crore which will be used to reduce borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Equirus Capital Private Ltd is the sole book-running lead manager.AWHCL undertakes municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and transportation (60% of revenue) and MSW processing (40% of revenue) projects through municipalities across India. As of January 2020, the company has 1089 vehicles and 17 ongoing MSW projects across various municipalities. Besides, it processes waste at Kanjurmarg, Mumbai and Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune. The Pimpri Chinchwad plant, a 14-megawatt waste-to-energy project, is expected to commence operations from FY22.Nevertheless, investors are not so gung-ho about the stock. “Antony Waste Handling Cell is a comparatively smaller IPO compared to the behemoth SBI Cards and due to the time clash, we feel that Antony Waste’s IPO will not get traction. Fundamentally too, this company has delivered poor growth in the past three years. To add to it, it is completely dependent on government authorities for its revenues as top five of its clients contribute over 90% of its revenue. Hence it faces high concentration risk,"" said Nirali Shah, senior research analyst, Samco Securities Ltd.The firm’s main source of revenue is from municipalities across India, which increases working capital receivables risk, noted Angel Broking. “AWHCL was unable to performance on top-line & bottom-line fronts over FY2017-19, and hence we believe that concerns regarding the company’s financials exist. Further, the business involves working capital and receivables risk from municipalities, which restricts the future growth opportunities,"" the brokerage noted in a report.However, given that as the firm contributes towards cleaner India, the business may see steady growth in the coming years of about 15%. A few brokerages have a subscribe rating on the stock given that waste management is a growing business. At the upper price band of  ₹300, AWHCL is available at a price-earnings multiple of 10 times its H1FY20 annualised earnings.""Valuation looks justified, considering the expected growth in earnings over the next few years,"" said an IPO note from Geojit Financial Services Ltd."

US has reported 64 cases, and India has confirmed six cases.WHO has stopped short of calling it a global pandemic but raised the global risk assessment of COVID-19 to ""very high"".World Bank's financial package will provide grants and low-interest loans from IDA for low income countries and loans from IBRD for middle income countries, using all of the Bank’s operational instruments with processing accelerated on a fast track basis. International Finance Corporation, the World Bank Group’s private arm, will provide its clients with the necessary support to continue operating and to sustain jobs.Countries face different levels of risk and vulnerability to COVID-19, and will require different levels of support. The support will prioritize the poorest countries and those at high risk with low capacity. As the spread of COVID-19 and its impact continues to evolve, the World Bank Group will adapt its approach and resources as needed."

316,Libra: Facebook's dream of creating single global digital currency is not over yet,"Facebook Inc. and its partners are considering redesigning the Libra cryptocurrency project so that the network accepts multiple coins, including those issued by central banks, in an effort to woo reluctant global regulators and rebuild momentum for the plan. When Facebook unveiled Libra, it said it intended to create a single global digital currency. Anyone, especially the 1.7 billion people who have no bank account, could send money anywhere in the world at little cost, as easily as sending a text.Eight months later, after the idea ran into a wall of opposition, Facebook and the Libra Association, the consortium behind the digital currency, are looking at a revamp, said three people familiar with the matter. They are weighing a recast of Libra as mostly a payments network that could operate with multiple coins, two of the people said.The coins could include those issued by central banks and backed by the US dollar, the euro or other currencies, the people said. The association will re-introduce Libra soon, said the people, who asked not to be named because the redesign remains in flux and the plan could change.The dream of a single global coin isn’t dead, said one of the people familiar with the overhaul. The new plan could expand, not pull back from, the original vision, that person said.But if the revamped Libra becomes more of a payments network than a single, global cryptocurrency, the average US consumer might not see much difference between Libra and existing payments systems run by PayPal Holdings Inc. or numerous fintech startups that aim to seamlessly move funds around the globe.“The Libra Association has not altered its goal of building a regulatory compliant global payment network, and the basic design principles that support that goal have not been changed,"" said Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, in a statement.Facebook said it “remains fully committed to the project.""What happened to Libra since its June 2019 unveiling is a story of hubris, wary lawmakers, protective regulators and partners fearful of the risks involved. Facebook and 27 other companies announced the project as a way to connect the globe -- while also circumventing the financial system -- and reduce the cost of sending money, especially for unbanked populations. The project’s members included Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and other large companies that would be Facebook’s partners in governing the system.As originally envisioned, the Libra coin would be created from a basket of relatively stable assets, such as US dollars and government bonds, euros, Singapore dollars, UK pounds and Japanese yen. A Libra Reserve made up of those currencies and debt instruments would support the token, whose value would adjust along with the underlying assets’ market value.But the plan almost immediately ran aground. US lawmakers said they didn’t trust Facebook to manage a financial network after the company’s high-profile missteps in other areas, especially its repeated failures to protect user data.Officials at some central banks said the new digital coin could undermine the sovereignty of their own currencies, while finance ministers worried that it could enable money laundering. Some European regulators vowed the project would never win approval.As the Geneva-based Libra Association tried to formalize its membership in October, many of its most prominent members, including Visa and Mastercard, dropped out. The project now has 20 of the original 28 members, though it recently added two others — cloud-based commerce company Shopify Inc. and cryptocurrency trading platform Tagomi Trading LLC.Even as some left the project for dead, representatives of Facebook and the association have continued to meet with officials at the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other US regulators to address their criticisms, the people familiar with the matter said.Treasury officials, in particular, have continued to focus on how the project will ensure the payments network isn’t used for money laundering, one of the people said.Some people connected to the Libra project worry that the SEC could rule that a coin backed by a basket of currencies is a security, which is a tradeable financial asset like a stock or a bond. Such a determination would subject the Libra to a slew of disclosure requirements and impose the same tight restrictions that the regulator places on stock offerings, undermining the coin’s usability.Central bank officials have also said that if Libra issues a coin backed by multiple currencies, it would undermine their ability to manage their own currencies.Since Facebook announced the Libra project, several central banks, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, have said they are exploring their own digital currencies. The overhaul is intended to ensure that the new payments network would be compatible, rather than in competition, with those projects, the people said.Libra and Facebook officials have spent the past few months traveling the world to speak at conferences, making the case that a payments network such as Libra could lower the cost of money transfers.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Facebook executive and Libra co-founder David Marcus emphasized that the Libra network wouldn’t preclude central bank projects.“I want to really make that distinction between the network and the assets that are running on top of the network, which I think could be issued by many different entities whether it’s central banks or the private sector,"" Marcus said, signaling that Libra’s new form could host multiple digital coins.“We think there’s a lot of momentum building,"" said Jennifer Campbell, the founder of Tagomi, one of the new members of the consortium. She said Libra “is definitely first and foremost a payment system. Within that there’s definitely also a coin that’s part of that strategy.""Libra could still face hurdles. Congressional staff and officials associated with Libra have said the project might be defined as systemically important, people familiar with the matter said. Should that happen, Libra could get yet another layer of regulation by the US Federal Reserve, which would mean following its rules on equity capital and stress testing.The Libra Association originally planned to launch its cryptocurrency this year, and Campbell said the technology is already being tested. But solving the regulatory challenges could take much longer, and Facebook has vowed that it won’t stay in the project without US approval.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

317,"Coronavirus: Global shortage of medical equipment, WHO asks to increase production","Washington/Geneva: The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday warned of a global shortage and price gouging for protective equipment to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus and asked companies and governments to increase production by 40% as the death toll from the respiratory illness mounted. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession and the World Bank announced $12 billion to help countries fight the coronavirus, which has taken a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries, threatening global economic growth prospects.The virus continued to spread in South Korea, Japan, Europe, Iran and the United States, and several countries reported their first confirmed cases, taking the total to some 80 nations hit with the flu-like illness that can lead to pneumonia.Despite the Fed's attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, US stock indexes closed down about 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors questioned whether the rate cut will be enough if the virus continues to spread.US lawmakers were considering spending as much as $9 billion to contain local spread of the virus.In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, one of the highest numbers outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks.The death toll in Italy, Europe's hardest-hit country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death, while Indonesia, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile reported their first coronavirus cases.About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, but the virus can be contained, the WHO chief said on Tuesday.""To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.Health officials have said the death rate is 2% to 4% depending on the country and may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.Since the coronavirus outbreak, prices of surgical masks have increased sixfold, N95 respirators have tripled in cost and protective gowns cost twice as much, the WHO said.It estimates healthcare workers each month will need 89 million masks, 76 million gloves and 1.6 million pairs of goggles.The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.There are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China. China's death toll was 2,946, with more than 166 fatalities elsewhere.In a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.Aggressive containmentIn the United States, there are now over 100 people in at least a dozen states with the coronavirus and nine deaths, all in the Seattle area.Amid criticism of Americans not being able to get tested for coronavirus unless they met certain limited criteria, US Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that anyone can now get tested with a doctor's order under new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).New York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.The public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major US city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying ""enhanced sanitising procedures"" for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.China has seen coronavirus cases fall sharply, with 129 in the last 24 hours the lowest reported since Jan. 20.With the world's second largest economy struggling to get back on track, China is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.Travellers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.The worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.WHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe cases.WHO emergency programme head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was ""more acute"" than for other countries.While the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, ""things tend to look worse before getting better.""The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths. Health officials said they would continue to monitor the situation in Japan before any final decision on the Olympics is made.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

319,New rift between US and China: Trump orders Chinese media houses to reduce staff,"The trade war may be on hold, but the US and China’s slide toward a new Cold War is only accelerating. The Trump administration’s decision to effectively expel much of China’s state-run media staff is the clearest sign yet of a fundamental shift in how Washington manages its relationship with Beijing. Starting March 13, four Chinese media companies will be allowed to employ a combined 100 Chinese citizens, a 40% cut from current levels, State Department officials told reporters Monday.The move casts aside long-held arguments that the US could steer the Communist Party in a more liberal direction by setting an example on human rights issues, such as freedom of the press. Instead, the Trump administration has expanded its demands for “reciprocity"" to cover a host of other facets of the relationship after reaching a preliminary trade deal with China in January.“For a long time, it was a generally shared judgment that displaying our open society for Chinese reporters and news organizations outweighed the lack of reciprocity for US,"" said James Green, a former American trade official in Beijing who’s now a senior research fellow with Georgetown University’s Initiative for US-China Dialogue on Global Issues. “With this decision, that calculation has changed.""That’s not just because Donald Trump is in the White House. Support for a more confrontational position toward China has been building over the past decade as Beijing increasingly challenged US leadership on everything from the security of the South China Sea to global rule-making to human rights. The more assertive policies of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the open hostility of Trump’s trade war have only lit a fire under that process.Major FlashpointThe media has always been a key point of friction, since the two societies have such divergent views on the press. Whereas American media companies are largely private and protected by the First Amendment, China’s news organizations are either state run or closely censored. All are overseen by the party’s Central Publicity Department, or the “Central Propaganda Department"" in Chinese.The exceptions in China are the foreign correspondents, whose reports provide rare windows into the world’s second-largest economy, especially during events that affect the world like the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Media organizations have complained of pressure from authorities, even as Chinese state media companies expanded their own footprints in the US and elsewhere overseas.Hu Xijin, editor of the Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper, warned late Tuesday that China “is mulling countermeasures and is determined not to back off.""Some 82% of Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China members said they experienced interference, harassment or violence while reporting last year, according to the group’s annual report. About one-fifth of respondents said they had difficulty securing visas due to issues related to their reporting.China rejected that assertion Tuesday, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian saying the country has never limited the number of US media agencies. Zhao condemned the decision, which he said “shows how hypocritical the US is while boasting of freedom of the press.""Tensions over the press have escalated over the outbreak, which has killed more than 2,900 people in China and prompted a rare outpouring of criticism against the government on social media. On Feb. 3, Xi told a meeting of the Politburo’s supreme Standing Committee that officials must do more to ensure the “the effectiveness of publicity work"" during the crisis, which he described as a “major test of China’s system and capacity for governance.""On Feb. 20, China’s foreign ministry took the unusual action of revoking the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters, prompting their expulsion. While the immediate reason was an opinion piece calling published by another section of the US newspaper that called China the “sick man of Asia,"" the timing underscored the growing risk of a tit-for-tat battle over journalist visas.A day earlier, the Trump administration had designated five Chinese media companies including the official Xinhua News Agency and state broadcaster China Global Television Network as “foreign missions,"" curbing their ability to acquire property and take other actions. The expulsion of the Wall Street Journal reporters prompted an intense debate in the White House over how to respond, Bloomberg News reported, citing officials familiar with discussions.Some including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued for a more moderate approach, especially as the two sides seek to stem the coronavirus outbreak. Ultimately, the administration decided to cut foreign staff allowances for five Chinese companies, including Xinhua and CGTN.‘In Line’“This is in line with Trump administration’s China policy,"" said Zhou Qi, director of the Institute of American Studies at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “It’s not surprising that the US government rolled out this latest restriction on the Chinese media, especially in the bigger context of the US designating China as its strategic rival and is growing wary of the Chinese presence on the ideological front.""Chinese outlets such as Xinhua have long blurred the lines between journalism and diplomacy, with generations of Chinese leaders relying on state media reporters to track developments overseas. The Xinhua office served as China’s de facto embassy in British Hong Kong and the agency’s journalists have in the past filed secret reports to party leaders from secure rooms in embassies, according to one former Chinese diplomat.While US officials were aware of the ambiguous missions of such outlets, the view was that openness would encourage more transparency from China. Now, openness has given way to confrontation.“It is clear that selective decoupling policies and measures from both countries will intensify over the medium to long term,"" said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to China’s cabinet and also a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “The carrot is getting smaller and the stick, however, is growing bigger.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

326,Moody's downgrades Vedanta Resources' corporate family rating to B1,"New Delhi: Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it has downgraded Vedanta Resources Limited's (Vedanta) corporate family rating (CFR). The rating was downgraded to B1 from Ba3.""Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Vedanta Resources Limited's (Vedanta) CFR to B1 from Ba3,"" it said in a statement.Moody's Corporate Family Ratings (CFR) are opinions on a corporate family's ability to honour all of its financial obligations.The agency said it has also downgraded the rating on senior unsecured bonds issued by Vedanta and those issued by its wholly owned subsidiary, Vedanta Resources Finance II Plc and guaranteed by Vedanta, to B3 from B2.The outlook on all ratings is stable, the statement said.""Today's downgrade of Vedanta's ratings was triggered by a sustained deterioration in the company's credit profile, and our expectation that its credit metrics will remain weak for the previous ratings,"" said Kaustubh Chaubal, Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.The agency said the low and volatile commodity price environment will mean that Vedanta's earnings are unlikely to improve significantly.Consequently, the company's financial profile will take longer than anticipated to strengthen, it said.""The rating actions also reflect Moody's revised view on the treatment of the loan raised in 2018 by Vedanta's sole shareholder, Volcan Investments, for Vedanta's privatization,"" the statement said.Its earlier analytical approach to assess Vedanta's credit strength was based on the separation of Vedanta and its operating subsidiaries from its shareholder, and the expectation that Volcan will not require Vedanta to service any of its debt obligations.""However, we now expect Vedanta to pay an additional dividend towards meeting Volcan's upcoming debt maturity. While we note that the additional dividend will be adjusted towards reducing dividend payments in the next fiscal year, it blurs the separation between the two companies,"" Chaubal added.The B1 CFR is supported by Vedanta's large scale and diversified low-cost operations that produce a wide range of commodities such as zinc, oil and gas, aluminum, iron ore and power, it said.In addition, the company's strong position in key markets that enable it to command pricing premium and track record of generating stable margins through commodity cycles support its business profile, and are key credit strengths, the statement said.The company has USD 1.9 billion of debt maturing at the holding company, which comprises the USD 670 million bond due in June 2021 and USD 1.2 billion of bank loans that have a staggered maturity. Vedanta's liquidity is weak at the holding company level and Moody's estimates the holding company held cash of less than USD 50 million as of December 31, 2019.The holding company's cash needs until September 2021 include USD 1.9 billion of debt maturities - - USD 670 million bond due in June 2021; Volcan's entire USD 625 million privatisation debt interest expense of USD 500 million and regular dividend payments.Further, the stable outlook incorporates Moody's expectation that Vedanta will upstream cash dividends from its operating subsidiaries to itself to repay debt and complete refinancing for the balance of the holding company debt in a timely manner.However, a delay in completing refinancing at least 12 months prior to the relevant maturity dates will exert negative pressure on the ratings, Moody's said.For the 12 months to September 30, 2019, Vedanta Resources generated revenues of $13.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of U3.3 billion.

327,"Bets going sour, SoftBank CEO promises he’ll be more careful","NEW YORK :SoftBank Group Corp. chief executive Masayoshi Son, under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management to rein in his mercurial investment style, turned on the charm in a meeting with US investors on Monday, but offered few concrete concessions. “I promise you I’ll start to be more careful and listen. My view doesn’t change, but my behaviour becomes a little more careful,"" sources quoted Son as telling investors, who attended his presentation at the Lotte New York Palace hotel in Manhattan.Son, who built SoftBank into a tech investment powerhouse, is now having to defend his track record after several of its expensive bets on startups, including office space-sharing firm WeWork, soured.Elliott, which oversees $40 billion in assets, has held discussions with SoftBank’s management and is calling on the company to buy back some $20 billion of its stock, improve its governance by increasing the independence and diversity of its board and improving transparency, people familiar with the matter said last month.Son said on Monday he had not given enough weight to the opinions of investors and the company’s independent board members, according to three people who attended the meeting, which was closed to the media, and gave details on condition of anonymity.Son pointed to SoftBank’s stock trading at a big discount to the value of its assets as an opportunity for investors to buy in.His approach to investing heavily in companies with disruptive technology potential and giving carte blanche to the founders of startups he backs has helped make him one of the world’s wealthiest investors. Yet it has also led to blunders that have blemished SoftBank’s performance. feedback@livemint.com"

While near-term challenges might slow the pace of investments, investors are expected to continue taking a long-term view on India, where they have pumped in a record $36.96 billion across 861 deals in 2019.“The short-term outlook for the economy is clearly challenging.

The principal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) cleared the NBCC proposal to take charge of incomplete projects of Jaypee Infratech and complete around 20,000 flats over the next three and half years.NCLT directed that the  ₹750 crore deposited by Jaypee Infratech parent Jaiprakash Associates Ltd with the Supreme Court’s registry will be part of the resolution plan as well.The bench said, “ ₹750 crore would be treated as part of the plan,"" news agency PTI reported. The bench added that certain modifications were made to the resolution plan approved by it. Finer details of the modifications made by the court would be known on Wednesday, once the written order is available.The resolution of Jaypee Infratech is likely to provide relief to distressed homebuyers and aid the Indian real estate sector, battling a severe demand slowdown. The Supreme Court on 6 November ordered that the resolution of Jaypee Infratech be completed within 90 days.Experts said resolution of large companies in distress under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) offered hope to investors. “Clarity has emerged in the IBC process due to various amendments to the code as well as judicial pronouncements, and there is much more confidence in the bankruptcy resolution process now,"" said Sumant Batra, managing partner of law firm Kesar Dass B and Associates. “While the resolution of Jaypee Infratech is another encouraging sign, it being a government agency coming forward, it is too early to say sentiments are going to improve dramatically for the real estate sector as a whole due to Jaypee."""
330,Staying slightly ahead of the curve is best strategy: Capgemini,"MUMBAI :For any firm that must be always on the front foot regarding trends in technology, consulting and outsourcing, it is a tough challenge hiring, training and retaining exceptional talent. For French multinational Capgemini, which employs 120,000 people in India, almost half of its global workforce, the strategy is to always stay slightly ahead of the curve.In an interview, Antoine Imbert, chief operations officer at Capgemini India, explained how his company is building a talent pool to tap customer demand without over-building capacity, while ensuring employees keep their skills sharp. Edited excerpts:Nasscom recently said that firms in India are spending 1-1.5% of their revenue on employee reskilling in IT sector. How much is Capgemini investing?Broadly, we are in line with industry standards. We trained more than 60,000 people last year. The way you deliver the training makes the difference. Randomly putting people in classroom training doesn’t help anyone even if you spend 5% of your earnings on training employees.We take a strategic and personalized approach by studying data that we have about the skills and experience of the employees. Then we shift towards a more experiential training program that can be tailored to specific needs. Finally, we ensure relevant billable assignments for them so that they can start putting the expertize to use immediately and if that is not available, we shift them to internal projects where they can practise those skills till they get such projects.That way, they can continue working on proof of concepts and other internal assignments and can show customers practical work experience.Is there a talent scarcity for the kind of new digital and just-in-time projects?The skill and talent shortage is more in geographies such as Europe than in India. For customers looking for talent for just-in-time projects, India is the most likely market where you will find sufficient talent to ramp up or scale operations.Of course, when specific requirements emerge, in my experience, there is some incubation and latency time for people to become up-to-date. It is preferable not to be too far up-to-date because you don’t want to have excess capacity with no avenue to deploy the talent. That becomes a demotivating factor for employees. Staying slightly ahead of the curve is the best strategy.What is your employee pyramid like? Are you also going after a fresher-heavy base like your competition since you announced that you will hire up to 30,000 this year?Increasing fresher capacity is one of our strategic objectives and we don’t expect any slowdown there.Sometimes, we confuse overall years of experience with years of experience in a new technology.You could have people with 15 years of experience and two years of experience in a new technology that is comparable to a fresher with two years of experience in the same technology. Of course, a longer experience base brings you other expertise as well."
331,"PM Modi’s Women’s Day campaign clever but poorly timed, say experts","NEW DELHI :Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s teaser campaign for Women’s Day seems well intended but poorly timed as India is in the midst of a series of crises, including the Covid-19 outbreak, deadly riots in the nation’s capital and a slowing economy, digital experts said. On Monday, Modi posted a cryptic tweet expressing his intention to quit social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. This turned out be a prelude to a campaign titled #SheInspiresUs.His tweet, retweeted almost 50,000 times, created a frenzy on Twitter. People posted messages with hashtags such as #ModiQuitsSocialMedia, #NoSir, #NoModiNoTwitter and #IWillAlsoLeaveTwitter to convince him to drop the idea. The campaign’s objective was, however, only to create curiosity before its formal launch for International Women’s Day on 8 March.As part of the campaign, Modi will hand over his social media handles to selected women who will share things about a better India. With more than 130 million followers across platforms, Modi is one of the most influential leaders online. Experts dubbed the tweet as a ‘clever teaser’ akin to what brands often do to create a buzz.However, while the idea is good, the timing is wrong, said Shrenik Gandhi, chief executive and co-founder at digital agency White Rivers Media.“It is good the head of state is putting across an inspiring campaign but the timing is off. I feel that the coronavirus spread, for instance, should be a bigger prerogative than a Women’s Day campaign,"" he said.Ashutosh Harbola, founder of influencer marketing company Buzzoka, said that #SheInspiresUs is probably the first teaser campaign ever done by any Prime Minister globally.“He created a high amount of curiosity by tweeting a day before which led to people discussing it. Even if it is a gimmick we should look at the end result which is about womanhood and celebrating it,""Harbola said.As part of the #SheInspiresUs campaign, Modi has urged citizens to share inspiring stories of women who have aced their respective fields.Sandeep Goyal, chairman of Mumbai-based marketing and communication agency Mogae Media, said that Modi knows social media better than any other politician in India.“I don’t think it is really a gimmick. It is making his personal real estate more ‘public’ and giving more power to the people. It elevates his handles, it enhances his ‘social’ stature and makes the handles more participative, broader based and most likely more interactive,"" he said."

Strict action will be taken against the MPs, be it of any party, who come to the well of the House. They will be suspended for the entire session,"" Birla said in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.The Speaker referred to an all-party meeting convened earlier in the day and ruled that any member who crosses over to the other side during proceedings would be suspended for the entire session.The ruckus in Parliament took place against the backdrop of the communal violence that shook north-east Delhi last week and led to more than 40 people being killed and several being seriously injured. Opposition parties, led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, have been demanding the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah over the issue.The situation in the Rajya Sabha was a little better with the Union government and the Opposition parties agreeing to hold a detailed discussion on the violence, despite repeated adjournments on Tuesday. The time and date of the discussion will be fixed after consultation with chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, even as Opposition parties have demanded an “urgent"" discussion.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also stepped in and told BJP MPs that the main message of the Union government was that unity and harmony are prerequisites of development. All parliamentarians should make efforts to maintain peace and harmony in the country, Modi said at a parliamentary party meeting.“Prime Minister Modi said that for development, there must be peace, unity and harmony. He also said that even today there are some parties that keep party interest above national interest,"" said parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.The Prime Minister told members of the ruling party that national interest was supreme for the BJP, Joshi said. “Prime Minister Modi at the BJP parliamentary party meeting said that we are here for the national interest and the nation is supreme,"" he said.In Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Birla had said that the discussion on the Delhi violence will take place on 11 March after the festival of Holi.

Kejriwal also appealed to the Prime Minister to ensure that those responsible for the riots are punished keeping aside their affiliation to a political party or religion.“The incidents over the past few days in Delhi were also discussed. I told him that on Sunday, there were many rumours across Delhi. The Delhi Police played a key role in appealing to people to maintain peace and stop the rumours. They managed to stop a big incident. Last week, Monday and Tuesday night saw the maximum amount of violence, all in one district. If the same action had been taken, then many lives could have been saved,"" he said.“I appealed and he also said that we need to ensure that such riots never take place in the national capital again.

334,RBI calms stock markets with assurance of policy action,"Mumbai: Indian stocks snapped a seven-day losing streak, gaining 1.26% on Tuesday, after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it is ready to take steps to mitigate financial market volatility. The rout in stock markets worldwide, including India, was also stemmed due to expectations of policy easing by major central banks to counter an economic contraction caused by the Covid-19 epidemic. The benchmark BSE Sensex rose 479.68 points to 38,623.70, while the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty index gained 1.53% to 11,303.30 points.Later in the day, the US Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point cut in interest rates, its biggest rate reduction since the 2008 global financial crisis. The emergency action is the first such coming in between scheduled Fed meetings since the financial crisis. However, US stocks were still trading lower at the time of writing this report.RBI said it is monitoring global and domestic developments closely and stands ready to take appropriate actions to ensure orderly functioning of financial markets, maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability. “Globally, financial markets have been experiencing considerable volatility, with the spread of the coronavirus triggering risk-off sentiments and flights to safe haven. Spillovers to financial markets in India have largely been contained. Growing hopes of coordinated policy action to mitigate a broader fallout to economic activity have boosted market sentiment today,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday.Markets in Asia were mixed, with equities in China and South Korea ending higher, while Japan and Hong Kong fell.“Comments by central bank officials over possible policy initiatives to curtail the economic impact held markets positive across the globe,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services. “Broad-based momentum was witnessed in metals and pharma, while the strong dollar led technology stocks higher. With nations across the globe taking precautions over the virus, further long-term economic impact looks minimal.""Domestic institutional investors (DIIs), including mutual funds and insurance companies, have been net buyers of  ₹21,460 crore in Indian stocks so far this year. However, a sell-off by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) has intensified in the last few trading sessions. FIIs have sold Indian shares worth $1.87 billion in the past six trading sessions ending Monday, but are overall net buyers of $1.79 billion so far this year.“Fluctuations in FII equity flows can also add to volatility,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. Although India is predominantly a domestic consumption-driven economy, its trade interlinkages with the world and integrated supply chains in several sectors bring in an element of risk, according to the brokerage firm.“In fact, this event has introduced additional downside risks to our earnings estimates for FY21,"" said the firm. “Till we see a semblance of normalcy returning to the global economy and markets, the Indian markets are likely to track global movements and stay narrow.""However, Rahul Singh, chief investment officer for equities at Tata Mutual Fund, said earnings of commodity-driven companies would be impacted as global slowdown has impacted commodity prices including that of crude oil. “Our interaction with Indian corporates, however, indicates that the inventory levels are adequate and some of the Chinese capacities are coming back gradually and they don’t expect the situation to get worse,"" he said.The rupee, on Tuesday, weakened past the 73-mark to hit a fresh 15-month low against the dollar as investors remained worried about the economic fallout of the virus outbreak.The Indian currency, which opened higher at 72.22, erased gains to end at 73.30. The rupee is the worst-performing currency among Asian currencies, falling 3% since 20 December. Among the other worst-performing currencies, the Thai baht fell 4.3% and the Singapore dollar 2.66%.“The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak and its consequent impact on global growth has led investors to question the likely pace of recovery, if any, this year,"" Tanvee Gupta Jain, an economist at UBS Securities India, said in a note to its investors. “We believe a weaker China and global growth, and disruptions along the supply chain (China share in India’s goods imports was 14% in 2019) are likely to have some adverse impact on India’s growth in the March 20 quarter.""Gopika Gopakumar contributed to this story."

336,UN human rights chief seeks to move Supreme Court over CAA,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Michelle Bachelet Jeria is set to file an intervention application in the Supreme Court over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, or CAA. The UN official seeks to intervene as amicus curiae (third party) in the petitions against CAA pending before the top court.“Our permanent mission in Geneva was informed yesterday (Monday) evening by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that her office had filed an intervention application in the Supreme Court of India in respect to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019,"" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.A UNHCHR spokesman in Geneva, however, said Jeria had not yet filed the application.The CAA, passed by Parliament in December, seeks to fast track citizenship for persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. It, however, leaves out the possibility of India giving citizenship to persecuted Muslims from these countries. Fears that this Act, along with plans to create a National Register of Citizens to weed out illegal immigrants and establish due Indian citizenship, could strip Indian Muslims of their citizenship has spurred protests across the country. Prime Minister Modi has said that there would be no repeal of the Act.The UNHCHR seeks to assist the apex court to examine the compatibility of CAA with India’s Constitution, in light of India’s obligations under international human rights laws. The interpretation of India’s international human rights obligations would include the right to equality before the law and the prohibition of discrimination among refugees and migrants, the UN body said. It also talks about CAA’s impact on the protection of human rights of migrants, including refugees in India.The UNHCHR said the intervention application should not be seen as an endorsement or associated with the allegation of any party to these proceedings, including those challenging the constitutionality of CAA before the Supreme Court. It also said the application is not restricted to issues raised by the petitions in the court on the CAA.The UNHCHR application asks whether excluding people on the basis of their religion is “objective and reasonable"".It says the Indian government pointed out that Islam is the state religion in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, and as such people of Muslim faith are protected in these countries. Those whose citizenship India seeks to fast-track through the CAA are religious minorities in these countries. However, the research done by UNHCHR states that a number of other religious groups, such as Ahmadi, Hazara and Shia Muslims, are among Muslim minorities in these countries. Hence, they should also be given protection under the provisions of the CAA.Kumar said, “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of Parliament to make laws. We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty.""“We are clear that the CAA is constitutionally valid and complies with all requirements of our constitutional values. It is reflective of our long standing national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of the Partition of India,"" he said.The Supreme Court would first have to decide whether the UNHCHR has the right to petition the court on this matter.The European Parliament is also set to debate a resolution that criticises the CAA and the communication clampdown in Kashmir. Together, the developments may cast a shadow over Modi’s visit to Brussels slated for 13 March for the India-European Union Summit.japnam.b@livemint.com"

In line with the plans, the ministry of heavy industries, the nodal ministry for the auto sector, has prepared a list of crucial parts for petrol and diesel as well as electric vehicles that can be airlifted from China in consultations with automakers and industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the people said, requesting anonymity.“The heavy industries ministry has made a list of components which can be airlifted for both set of vehicles. Otherwise, there will be shutdown of assembly lines. Also, the orders from China come with a lag of three to four months and factories have been shut since February. So the next few months will be a washout,"" said an executive at a leading automaker and one of the three people cited above.However, electric vehicle makers in India may be forced to halt production in April and May because of the ongoing shortage of parts from China, which tends to be the single source for several critical components for such vehicles, the executive said. And as Sohinder Gill, director general at the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles and also the chief executive at Hero Electric, explained, lithium-ion cells cannot be airfreighted as they come under the hazardous cargo category.The heavy industries ministry and other nodal ministries haver sent the list of proposal to the aviation ministry, which would carry out the plans, if approved, along with airlifting of parts for mobile phones and drugs, a senior government official said separately.The list of parts submitted by automakers include for Bharat Stage-VI engines and electric vehicles whose localisation levels are currently low.Vinodkumar Ramachandran, India head for industrial and automotive sectors at KPMG Advisory Services Pvt Ltd, said if Covid-19 does not spread to other provinces in China, production of auto parts would stabilize there by Q2 FY21. “However, in the context of India, once the adequate stocks are consumed, the shortage of parts supply from China could have a cascading impact on vehicle production. Meanwhile, for EVs, cell manufacturing has a consolidated presence in Asia across China, Japan and Korea.

340,Elderly people may be more at risk of developing severe illness from Covid-19,"NEW DELHI :A global team of scientists has suggested that older individuals seem to be at higher risk of developing severe illness from Covid-19. In its latest report, a joint mission of the World Health Organization (WHO) and China, found that individuals more than 60 years old and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk of critical illness and death from Covid-19.The scientists travelled across mainland China, which has 90% of the total cases worldwide.The data shows the highest death rate of 14.8% among people more than 80 years old. Patients who reported having retired had the highest case fatality rate (CFR) at 8.9%, or nearly nine out of every 100 people diagnosed.Patients who had no underlying ailments had better chances of recovery, showing a fatality rate of 1.4%. A fatality rate of 13.2% was recorded for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8% for chronic respiratory disease and 7.6% for cancer.The probability of severe infections was found to be more among men than women, a trend that baffles scientists. In mainland China, the death rate among men (4.7%) was found to be double that of women (2.8%). Pregnant women did not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease.“This is a trend we have been seeing across all countries, (and it) could hold the same for India too. But, in case of China, it could also be linked to high level of smoking,"" said G. Arunkumar, head, Manipal Institute of Virology.Children appeared to be relatively safe, with mostly “rare and mild"" infections, and less probability of transmitting infections. The risk also appeared significantly lower for youngsters, as only 2.4% of the total reported patients were 19 years old or younger. Further, only 0.2% of them developed a critical disease.“Older people tend to have a compromised immune system, which could render them susceptible. However, we have no clear answers. It is a very fluid situation, but it looks certain that there would be more cases as it spreads for sometime,"" said Dr Shobha Broor, a New Delhi- based virologist.The team also found that the virus is being transmitted largely via droplets and fomites (contaminated objects) during close unprotected contact with an infected person.People take on an average five to six days to show the symptoms. At least 87% of infected cases show fever as the most common symptom, followed by dry cough in 67% of cases and fatigue in 38% of them. Some patients also suffered from shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%) and chills (11.4%)."
341,"Infection concerns cause demand spike for sanitizers, masks","Pharmacies and general stores in the Delhi-NCR region are seeing a rush for hand sanitizers and preventive masks after fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported. Some shops reported a shortage of sanitizers on Tuesday evening, a day after the government confirmed two fresh cases of Covid-19, one in Delhi and the other in Telangana.In the absence of a vaccine to Covid-19, health authorities have advised people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or use alcohol-based sanitizers.To be sure, hand sanitizers and hand washes, unlike soaps are still a small category within the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market. As a result, general trade stores and pharmacies don’t overstock such products.“There is a lot of panic since the Delhi case has emerged,"" said Amit Gupta, who works at the Gupta Brothers Chemist in central Delhi. He said the store has lost count of the number of bottles of sanitizers sold, adding: “Distributors are not being able to give the stock.""Masks typically see a surge during Delhi’s pollution spurts in October-November. “We still have those as of now,"" Gupta added.“Sanitizers and hand washes are a very small category, at least the branded ones. But today, if you see their demand, it’s up almost five-fold; so companies don’t have so much stock, plus export demand has been going up,"" Dhairyashil Patil, national president at the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) said.FMCG companies said they continue to put sufficient products out in the market.“There is adequate supply of Savlon hand washes, soaps, antiseptic liquids and sanitizers in the market,"" said Sameer Satpathy, divisional chief executive, personal care products business, ITC Ltd.“Starting mid-Jan, there has been a rise in demand for our products. However, since yesterday, it has spiked some 400%,"" said Vikas Bagaria, founder and managing director of PeeSafe that sells hygiene products including masks and alcohol-free hand sanitisers.A spokesperson for Hindustan Unilever said there’s “a heightened need"" for hygiene products at the moment, adding: “We have adequate stock of hand sanitizers and hand-wash soap and are geared to meet the increased demand for our products."""
342,Travel and hospitality sector may take a big hit as outbreak widens,"The travel and hospitality sector is facing the heat with the deadly Covid-19 spreading not only to Europe and Iran but also to India, with bookings being cancelled or rescheduled at a fast pace. Operators such as Thomas Cook, SOTC, FCM Travel Solutions, Yatra and MakeMyTrip admitted their businesses have been hit. They are offering the option of deferring trips or availing future travel vouchers, refunds and even alternative destinations to Indian travellers who have booked on the China and South-East Asia route.“Till now predominantly the Asian continent was impacted with travellers cancelling and rescheduling travel. Now rising reports from Italy, Spain, and Switzerland mean that the popular Europe sector will also be impacted. No authority is coming out and declaring if a particular country is safe to travel to and this is adding to the travel fears,"" said Mahendra Vakharia, executive council member of Outbound Tour Operators Association of India.Sabina Chopra, co-founder and chief operating officer (corporate travel) at Yatra Online Pvt. Ltd, said, “South-East Asia and Italy being one of the most preferred destinations for Indians, we can anticipate a drop of 20-25% in terms of future bookings, though it is too early to predict any drastic impact. Travellers are wary of making fresh bookings to the affected locations... We have received about 35% of cancellation queries from travellers planning their trips to foreign locations during the season.""“Data on our platform indicates that flight bookings for South-East Asian countries have been significantly impacted. However, countries in the Western region, including the US and Europe, are seeing a marginal dip in numbers,"" said a spokesperson of MakeMyTrip. The firm says 20% of its overall business comes from outbound travel,Hospitality chain Hilton, which operates nearly 6,000 properties globally, did not give out the business impact. “We are actively monitoring novel coronavirus (Covid-19) updates from the World Health Organization, the government, and public health authorities. We will continue to respond based on their advice. Precautionary safety and heightened hygiene and sanitation practices and measures has been implemented across all our hotels,"" said a Hilton India spokesperson.FCM Travel said it has seen a dip of 12-13% in leisure and 10-11% in corporate travellers from India to China. “While there have been cancellations, a lot of it is triggered by apprehension and panic. Barring a few places in South-East Asia and Europe, there are several places like Bali, the UK, central and eastern European countries where people can still go,"" said Anand Menon, brand leader, Travel Tours at FCM.Subhash Goyal, chairman of the tourism and hospitality council at the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, said there could be a silver lining if the government aggressively capitalized on the impact of the virus on China to tap tourism. China attracts 50-60 million tourists each year, while India gets about 10 million.“There is a hike in enquires to domestic destinations such as Andaman and Nicobar, Goa, Ujjain, and the northeast cities, among others,"" he said.Biman Mukherji contributed to this story."

The measures came after three people tested positive—one each in Delhi, Jaipur and Telangana. Six others in Agra are suspected to have contracted the disease, which has spread rapidly across the world, hitting South Korea, Italy and Iran after the December outbreak in China.One of the three people who tested positive, the man from Delhi, was found to have a child studying in a top Noida school, prompting the school authorities to ask all parents to quarantine their children at home for two weeks. Another school in the vicinity was also shut as a precaution.“In the wake of the recent outbreak of virus and flu, we request you to not send your child to school if he/she has a cold/cough or fever.

344,"WhatsApp Dark mode is now official, on both Android and iOS platforms","Dark Mode for WhatsApp, a feature that has been doing the rounds in the rumour mills, is finally available officially. While the feature has been seen in various beta versions of the app earlier, the company made it officially available on both Android and iOS platforms today. The company says it focused on two areas while “researching and experimenting"" with dark mode. That includes readability and information hierarchy. WhatsApp says it wanted to reduce eye fatigue, which is a common claim behind dark modes from any other app or software.The feature will be available to users on phones that run on Android 10 and iOS 13 (or later). It can be used by enabling the system-wide dark mode feature available on both Android and iOS platforms now.Dark Mode, in theory, uses less battery since your phone’s screen can turn off more pixels in order to show the darker colours. However, the difference is usually not significant enough. Many users have said they prefer dark modes in apps and operating systems from an appearance point of view and because it puts less strain on the user’s eyes, especially when using your phone in low lit areas.Apps like Google Chrome, Twitter, Microsoft Outlook, Gmail and many others are also available in dark versions."
345,Airlines in India brace for turbulent weather,"NEW DELHI :Airlines in India are bracing for turbulent weather as a fast-spreading Covid-19 epidemic leads many to shun air travel. Vistara, run by Tata SIA Airlines Ltd, has skipped Tokyo for its first long-haul international flight in the June quarter and will instead tap either London, Paris or Frankfurt because of a sharp slump in air travel demand in Asia, a person aware of the matter said. Vistara has already cancelled about 54 flights to Thailand and Singapore for March.National carrier Air India Ltd and InterGlobe Aviation Ltd-operated IndiGo have suspended flights to China and Hong Kong while SpiceJet has suspended flights to Hong Kong. Over 3,100 people have died from Covid-19 infections that surfaced in China, while the number of those infected stands at over 91,000.Air India, which has suspended flights to China and Hong Kong till 30 June, is bracing for loss on some of its international routes. “There will be some revenue loss definitely, but we are utilizing these aircraft in other routes,"" said a senior Air India executive, who asked not to be named.IndiGo too is bracing for a financial impact. “We will have to see how the outbreak of the coronavirus pans out. With summer approaching, we are hoping for this to be contained as stated by medical experts,"" said an IndiGo official requesting anonymity.“If the current epidemic continues and spreads further, the aviation sector could see weak demand. However, low oil prices are a positive. The recent cut of jet fuel by about 10% could bring our fuel costs down by about 4% during the quarter,"" the official added.On Monday, Vistara’s chairman Bhaskar Bhat said the Indian aviation industry is bracing for a capacity reduction in international sectors due to the outbreak. The capacity is expected to be redeployed to domestic sectors, Bhat added.Though domestic operations have largely remained unaffected by the spread of the virus, the Indian aviation industry could see its international traffic growth reduce by at least a fifth if flights to and from South-East Asian countries are completely suspended, said rating agency Icra.Indian aviation industry could see a maximum impact of 19.5-23.8% on international passenger traffic growth if there is a complete suspension of flights to and from South- East Asian countries including China, which could affect about 4.5-5.5 million passengers, Kinjal Shah, vice president, Icra, said in the statement.“This is negative for the Indian aviation industry, which is already reeling under significant passenger traffic slowdown, with the international traffic growth for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 having witnessed a decline of 8.4%,"" Shah added.“We hope that the outbreak of the coronavirus is contained. At present, domestic operations of Indian carriers haven’t been affected much. But, if the virus outbreak persists, it will be difficult for the domestic aviation industry to register a double digit growth in the near future,"" a senior government official said, requesting anonymity.Care Ratings said India received 10.9 million foreign tourists in 2019, of which China accounted for about 3.1% and that in the absence of foreign arrivals from China, foreign exchange earnings could take a beating. The government has temporarily suspended e-visas to Chinese nationals and others residing in China."
346,Sitharaman meets PM to discuss measures to support industries,"NEW DELHI :Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss measures to support the industry and tackle disruption from the Covid-19 epidemic. “The meeting was held to discuss ways to support industries such as pharma that will be impacted by the outbreak of the disease,"" a government official said.Besides, as part of a long-term strategy, the government is devising ways in which India can be self-sufficient in raw materials by setting up manufacturing units in the country.“The industry should make the best use of this opportunity so that some manufacturing can shift from China to India,"" the official said.Last week, Sitharaman told reporters that the finance ministry is closely monitoring the impact of the epidemic on the Indian economy. Mint had reported that top finance ministry officials met on 29 February to assess feedback from different arms of the government handling aviation, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, textiles, information technology and heavy industries on ways to deal with the epidemic.Modi tweeted on Tuesday, “Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the Covid-19 Novel Coronavirus. Different ministries & states are working together, from screening people arriving in India to providing prompt medical attention.""The epidemic spreading to a large number of countries has added to economic uncertainties and disruption in global trade. The development comes at a time when the Indian economy grew at its slowest pace in more than six years at 4.7% in the December quarter.On Monday, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) slashed India’s growth forecast for 2020-21 by 1.1 percentage points to 5.1%, warning that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on business confidence, financial markets and the travel sector, including disruption to supply chains, could shave 50 bps off global growth in 2020.Since it was first reported in late December in China, the number of people infected has now topped 92,000 globally, and while more than 80,000 of these are in China, infections in other countries, especially Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan, have seen an alarming rise. While there have been no deaths in India at the moment, currently, three individuals are undergoing treatment for the virus and three cases earlier detected in Kerala have recovered.Covid-19, commonly referred to as the novel coronavirus, has been spreading fast and claiming more lives and has impacted the financial markets.Earlier in the day, the central bank said it is monitoring global and domestic developments around Covid-19 closely and continuously and is ready to take appropriate actions."
347,No quick pill to plug China drug supply shortage,"The Directorate General of Foreign Trade has curbed the export of 13 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their formulations with immediate effect due to the Covid-19 outbreak in China. Mint analyses how the disease could hit the supply of medicines from China. What’s the status on API supply to firms?The medicines we consume have raw materials called APIs, which in turn are made from intermediates. Indian firms are global leaders in the manufacture of formulations, which are finished products. They also make some bulk drugs and intermediates, but around 70% of these are imported from China. Indian firms had a higher inventory than usual when the outbreak started in January as they had sourced their APIs to create sufficient inventory for 2-3 months due to the holiday period in China. Now, large firms such as Cipla have said they have stocks till April, but some small ones and wholesale API traders are facing a crunch.The drug trail Do Indian drug makers manufacture APIs?For drugs such as efavirenz, linezolid and rifapentine, the entire supply chain, including the production of APIs and their intermediates, is majorly in India. However, China is the major supplier of APIs and intermediates for most drugs, especially fermentation-based APIs such as certain antibiotics, vitamins, hormones and medicines to treat some cardiovascular diseases. India had a significant production for APIs such as penicillins G and V, cephalosporin, vitamin B12, among others, but these units were shut down over the last two decades as they were unviable in comparison to facilities in China.How much does India depend on China for APIs?Data given by the government to the Lok Sabha shows Indian firms imported bulk drugs and intermediates worth $2.4 billion in 2018-19, the other sources being the US, Italy, Singapore and Hong Kong. Indian firms depend most on China for fermen-tation-based APIs used in antibiotics such as tetracycline and erythromycin, and cardiovascular drugs such as pravastatin.What’s the govt doing to offset an impact?Export curbs have been placed on 13 APIs and their formulations, including paracetamol, vitamins B1, B6 and B12, progesterone and erythromycin. The decision was based on a recommendation by a panel set up by the department of pharmaceuticals to look at steps to reduce dependence on China. Some steps considered are those suggested in 2015 by a government panel headed by V.M. Katoch, such as setting up bulk drug parks, faster environmental clearance for new API plants and changing the product mix in an existing unit.Are closed API units in India likely to revive?Industry experts say that while a revival is possible over three-five years, this would entail enormous expenditure to buy equipment, while cheap land, power and water are a necessity. Some industry officials say the government has not provided incentives for setting up API units. But the government’s measures to raise capacity of API plants is showing signs of moving forward: Four proposals have been received by the government to set up bulk drug parks in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Telangana and Himachal Pradesh."
348,India’s film business braces for decline as crisis may hit box office collections,"New Covid-19 cases in India may well affect box office collections, though the impact of the virus on the Indian film business has been minimal till now. The first quarter of FY21 may see many films being deferred if things get worse, according to a report by brokerage firm Elara Securities Pvt. Ltd. This could result in a downgrade of 12-14% in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for multiplex chains such as PVR Cinemas and INOX Leisure Ltd.Bollywood, which contributes 65% of the total revenue of these chains, has major offerings lined up from April, including director Kabir Khan’s sports drama ’83, Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana-starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Salman Khan’s action drama Radhe—Your Most Wanted Bhai, Akshay Kumar-starrer Laxmmi Bomb, Yash Raj Film’s Bunty Aur Babli 2 and Kangana Ranaut-starrer Thalaivi, a biopic on actor-politician Jayalalithaa.“Some of the large releases may also be postponed in case cinemas call for a closure in the coming months. We will monitor the number of new cases closely to ascertain the exact impact on footfall in cinemas,"" said Karan Taurani, research analyst with Elara.The virus has already had an effect elsewhere. In China, some 70,000 theatres have been shut, and the lunar year weekend grossed about $2 million against $360 million last year, a Quartz report said.Box office collections in Italy were down 25% year-on-year (y-o-y) in February. Overall, March could see a decline of over 50% y-o-y in the country that has reported over 1,600 confirmed cases.Movie releases in Japan have been put off as most cinema chains have sought a temporary closure. In Korea, ticket sales fell almost 65% over the past weekend compared with two weeks earlierBollywood is already on track to one of its worst quarters. January and February together saw a adrop of 11% y-o-y with underperformers including titles like Chhapaak ( ₹34.08 crore), Street Dancer ( ₹68.28 crore), Panga ( ₹28.92 crore) and Love Aaj Kal ( ₹34.80 crore).While cinema chains actually shutting operations would depend on the gravity of the situation, the idea that people would be fearful of stepping out and of large crowds is not too far-fetched. “Of course the safety of movie viewers is of utmost importance and there are countries that have already brought in restrictions but the call in India would depend on government directives,"" said film trade and exhibition expert Girish Johar.Only time would tell how theatre owners respond to the crisis, if there is one, said Rajendar Singh, vice-president, programming and distribution, INOX Leisure."
349,Screen all coming to India for coronavirus irrespective of flight's country of origin: IATO,"New Delhi: The Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) on Tuesday asked the government to screen all travellers coming to India, irrespective of which country they are coming from amid rising number of coronavirus cases. IATO has learnt from its members and travellers that there is weak or no screening being done at Indian airports upon arrival at international airports other than the nationals from the affected countries, the association said in a statement.It was thought that India is relatively safe with no cases of COVID-19 virus being reported but the scenario has changed in the last two days with cases being detected in various parts of the country, it said.""In view of this fast-moving development, IATO urges government to screen all travellers irrespective of the country from where they are travelling to India,"" the statement said.More recent cases of coronavirus have been reported from Delhi, Telangana and Jaipur (Rajasthan).IATO said that at some of the international airports in other countries, thermal screening is being done for everyone in the flight starting from cockpit crew, cabin crew and all the passengers. This is being done inside the aircraft before passengers de-board the aircraft.Keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter and risk involved, IATO said, ""All the international travellers, including aircraft crew members, should be screened upon arrival from all the countries in similar way to avoid outbreak or spreading of coronavirus in our country.""There must be 100 per cent screening for all the international travellers at all international airports in India and ""no flight must be excluded as we get airlines flying in from hubs that have passengers from all over the world"", it added.

350,Opinion | The Fed jumps in,"Should ease and cut rate big. Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve has called it wrong from day one. Sad!"" US President Donald Trump may want to rescind the second line of this tweet. Hours after it was put out on Monday, the US Fed cut its policy rate of interest by half-a-percentage-point. This came two weeks ahead of its scheduled meeting to take any such call. That credit was eased so dramatically points to fears of a global recession brought on by Covid-19, which has so far claimed more than 3,100 lives worldwide and threatens to paralyse economic activity far beyond China. Closer home, the Reserve Bank of India was talking on Tuesday of “growing hopes of a coordinated policy action"" even before the Fed surprise. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is about a month away, but India’s exposure to Covid-19 risks may prompt the rate-setting body to act in advance. The case for a rate cut in India is not so clear, though. While crude oil prices have slid, inflation remains a worry. Also, the rupee has been weakening. Yet, if a Covid-19 outbreak poses a big threat to the economy, then all earlier bets would be off the table."
351,"Vistara weighs London, Frankfurt, Paris for its first long-haul flight","NEW DELHI :The outbreak of Covid-19 has led to a change in plans at Vistara for its first long-haul international flight, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The airline, run by Tata SIA Airlines Ltd, was considering Tokyo among potential cities for its first long-haul destination. Instead, it is currently evaluating London, Paris and Frankfurt, the person said requesting anonymity.“Vistara will consider flying to Japan once the situation improves,"" the person said. The airline, a joint venture between Tata Sons Ltd and Singapore Airlines, is hopeful that the fast-spreading Covid-19 epidemic would subside in the summer, the person added.On London as one of the potential destinations for its inaugural long-haul flight, Vistara’s chief executive Leslie Thng on Monday said the airline will definitely fly to London, “the jewel of European destinations"" in future.“The problem with London is getting a slot at the Heathrow airport. Vistara is trying to either buy a slot from an airline which already operates there, possibly a loss-making airline which is looking to give up its slot or lease a slot for a specific period of time,"" the person cited above said adding the airline is expected to take a decision soon.Slots at busy airports like Heathrow are hard to come by. A single slot at Heathrow can cost up to $70 million, according to British news reports.Singapore Airlines, one of the joint venture partners of Tata SIA Airlines, currently has at least four slots at Heathrow. Mint couldn’t immediately ascertain if Vistara has approached Singapore Airlines to lease a slot at the airport. The outbreak of Covid-19 has adversely affected tourism and air traffic in South-East Asia, including Singapore.“If Heathrow doesn’t work out for the airline, London’s Gatwick airport, where there are slots available, is an option. A lot of other full-service carriers have operations from that airport,"" the person added.Vistara hopes to start long-haul international flights in the June quarter and will take delivery of four Boeing 787s before December 2020. The airline took delivery of its first Boeing 787-9 aircraft in February and plans to add three more such aircraft in March, May and June-July.Vistara’s first long-haul international flight will be to countries where it has existing code share with airlines. Vistara has code-share agreements with Lufthansa, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, United Airlines and Japan Airlines.Code sharing allows an airline to book its passengers on partner carriers and provide seamless travel to destinations where it has no presence.However, the airline will not be able to fly to the US, at least until next year.“Vistara’s Boeing 787-9 aircraft is configured in such a way that it will not be able to fly non-stop to the US. All four Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which are to be delivered to the airline this year, have the same configuration and hence can’t be utilized to fly directly to the US,"" the person said. “However, the Boeing 787-9 aircraft the airline takes next year will be able to fly to the US. So, the airline could start its US flights then,"" the person added."

354,"Fundraising, profitability crucial for co-working startups this year","BENGALURU :After a phase of rapid expansion, co-working startups are looking to raise fresh capital and turn profitable to support the next leg of growth, as demand for collaborative workspaces remains high in India. The dynamics of collaborative workspaces are also changing and moving towards enterprise clients with long-term commitments, and building customized products, rather than chasing smaller startups and entrepreneurs, and leasing individual desks, or seats.Top operators, such as WeWork India, Smartworks Coworking Space Pvt. Ltd, Awfis Space Solutions Ltd and Table Space Technologies, along with smaller firms, such as IndiQube and CoWrks, make up over 80% of flexible space leasing and are looking at strategic expansion through an asset-light or revenue sharing model, to burn less cash.“The co-working market today is driven mainly by the top operators with multi-city presence. Expansion was the focus so far, but now that it’s an established form of business, they are looking at profitability, raising capital and the operational part. It’s a volume-driven business, so operators are looking at prime locations, larger clients,"" said Viral Desai, national director, office transactions, Knight Frank India.IndiQube, which had raised capital from WestBridge Capital India Advisors in 2018, is looking to raise $30-50 million to fuel expansion as the Bengaluru-based firm looks to nearly double its 2.5 million sq.ft operational space in the next 12-15 months.“Larger enterprises are asking for bigger spaces. The momentum has built up and we need a new round of funding for further expansion. We are undertaking buildings that can be upgraded or converted to office spaces as well as distress assets stuck with lenders,"" said Rishi Das, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO), IndiQube. The firm has already turned profitable.WeWork India has already added 5,000 seats this year and plans to touch 10,000 seats by June. However, a lot also rides on the fundraising plans it had announced last October to support growth. The Indian affiliate of the New York-based We Co. also plans to turn profitable this year.“While we continue to grow and hold on to our market share, the larger focus is on profitability. Capital is a big driver, on how fast or slow we grow. Unlike earlier, when we tried to grow fast, we are now looking at deals where the desks we are adding are funded by landlords, in fully-funded management contracts or revenue sharing,"" said Karan Virwani, who heads WeWork India.Even Bengaluru-based CoWrks, which had said last year that it will raise $50 million, is still self-funded and not raised any external capital so far. Abhishek Goenka, CEO, CoWrks, said while it will add 15,000-20,000 seats this year, no one is building speculatively anymore and are moving towards built-to-suit facilities.India’s co-working segment has seen significant growth in recent years and is now a catalyst of sorts for modern workspaces. The share of co-working in total office leasing spiked from 8% in 2018 to 14% in 2019, according to JLL India estimates.Smartworks Coworking Space Pvt. Ltd, which turned profitable last year, and raised $25 million from Singapore’s Keppel Land last year, follows the traditional deal with landlords, and has started taking up larger spaces across the top nine Indian cities. “Today, everyone is focusing on profitability rather than just achieving the topline and there is no irrational expansion,"" Smartworks founder Neetesh Sarda said.Awfis Space Solutions Ltd, one of the largest and well-funded co-working startups, plans to set up centres in even smaller cities such as Kochi, Ahmedabad and Indore.Awfis founder and CEO Amit Ramani said the startup has adopted various formats, including managed aggregation in partnership with landlords and an asset-light model, besides offering a few seats for small businesses, and providing up to 1,000 seats for a large enterprise."
355,Dow plunges 3% as Fed's emergency rate cut spooks Wall Street,"Wall Street stocks fell further Tuesday afternoon as markets reacted skeptically to the Federal Reserve's surprise interest rate cuts to boost the US economy. Near 1905 GMT, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 25,837.44, down 3.2 percent or 865 points.The broad-based S&P 500 shed 3.1 percent to 2,993.84, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slid 3.3 percent to 8,653.23.Stocks initially rallied after the Fed's surprise rate cut announcement, but equities later pulled back as investors questioned whether the move suggested the US economy was on shakier ground than previously thought.It was the Federal Reserve's first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis, underscoring how grave the central bank views the fast-evolving situation.""The market reaction now is negative because the Fed sent the wrong message to the market,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.""All of a sudden the Fed is really worried about the economy and this is the reason why we are having this volatility.""Earlier in the day, Fed Chair Jerome Powell took part in a Group of Seven conference call, which pledged appropriate actions to support the economies.The US central bank cut rates three times in 2019 and has since held fire amid signs of improving growth after a Phase-1 trade deal between the United States and China.Bank stocks, which tend to outperform when interest rates are higher, dropped 3.4%, while the broader financials sector fell 2.6%.

356,Majority of promising AI startups are still based in the US: Study,"Washington: The most promising startups using artificial intelligence are US-based companies working in the fields of health care, retail and transportation, according to a study that looked at budding AI companies around the world. Of the top 100 startups in AI, 65% were based in the U.S., though some of those had dual headquarters in China or elsewhere, according to the analysis by CB Insights, a tech research group that analyzed data on close to 5,000 startups around the world.“These would be companies to watch that are doing really interesting research in AI,"" said Deepashri Varadharajan, the lead analyst on the report. “Some of them might get acquired. Some might have successful product launches.""The research group considered venture capital investment, patent activity and market potential to develop its list of the companies most likely to succeed. The high percentage of U.S.-based companies reflect the country’s historical dominance in AI research, Varadharajan said.More than 4,300 startups in 80 countries have raised $83 billion since 2014, including $26.6 billion just last year, according to CB Insights. While the dollar figures for investment have grown rapidly, the share of U.S.-based investments dropped in that period to 39% from 71%.“The U.S. still has the most number of deals, but that deal share has started to drop as other countries are starting to fund technologies,"" she said. “The vast majority are automating specific tasks in white-collar settings.""That echoes a Brookings Institution study last year that found white-collar jobs are most likely to see an impact from AI, particularly in the life sciences and computer industries.Top ranked firms in the CB Insights ranking included several unicorns, or startups whose private valuations reached $1 billion or more. These include the following: Butterfly Network, which is building an ultrasound device that uses AI-assisted diagnostics; Faire Wholesale Inc., which helps local retailers determine what goods are predicted to sell best in specific locations, and DataRobot, whose tools help companies develop their own AI applications.Some of the startups already have begun work with larger companies, including Caspar.AI, a U.S. and Japan-based firm that’s working with Panasonic Corp. on smart home products and ClimaCell Inc., a climate-monitoring firm that’s partnered with Alphabet Inc.’s Google, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Delta Air Lines Inc. Google also is working with U.K.-based InstaDeep Ltd., which builds AI systems for other companies in the fields of logistics, energy and electronic design.What the companies have in common is that they are addressing a need within specific industries and, in many cases, breaking through bottlenecks, Varadharajan said.“You can be using AI, that’s great, but is there a problem that you’re trying to solve?"" she said. “It can be an industry-specific need or pushing the boundaries of core research itself.""The health-care startups were looking at diagnostics, health monitoring and enhancing imaging. AI companies are working to develop commuter modeling, waste recycling and mapping for city planning. Improving the energy grid, anti-fraud features in the finance industry, and indoor farming are some of the other areas where AI is being used.Some future trends she pointed to include energy efficiency, improving quantum computing and doctored videos called deepfakes.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

358,Pope 'tests negative for coronavirus' as Vatican ups controls,"Pope Francis, who is suffering from a cold, has tested negative for the coronavirus, an Italian newspaper reported Tuesday, as Italy battles Europe's worst outbreak. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni did not respond to an AFP request for comment on the Messaggero newspaper report, and sources said it was unlikely the Holy See would comment on the pope's health Tuesday.Francis cancelled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy this weekend, after axing all public meetings at the end of last week over the cold.""Unfortunately, a cold forced me not to take part this year,"" the 83-year-old pontiff told a crowd on Saint Peter's Square after suffering two coughing fits while reciting his traditional Angelus Prayer.The new coronavirus has spread from China across much of the world, Italy among the worst affected with over 2,000 people infected and 52 deaths.The Argentine-born pope has been seen coughing and blowing his nose for days.With rumours swirling that the pope himself had come down with COVID-19, the Vatican issued a formal denial on Sunday.""There is no evidence to suggest a diagnosis of anything other than a slight ailment,"" a spokesman told AFP.Francis was tested for the disease last Wednesday after showing cold symptoms following a period outside in the wind.- Controls tightened -The Vatican has been projecting an image of calm, releasing a pre-recorded message from the pope on Tuesday and stressing that he was still scheduled to deliver his Angelus Prayer on Sunday.But the vast crowds that usually throng Saint Peter's Square, and the queues that snake in front of the museums are gone.The Vatican is set to supply staff working in close contact with tourists with masks and gloves, the Messaggero reported.The pope has enjoyed a life of good health despite losing part of a lung as a young man and suffered from sciatica -- a nerve condition that causes pain in his hip.Yet he rarely cancels appointments and normally takes extra time to mingle with supporters and the faithful.The Vatican itself has had at least one coronavirus-related scare.The offices of a French priest working at the Vatican's ministry of communication were disinfected on Monday, following the quarantine of his community of 20 priests from Rome's Church of St Louis of the French.They had been in contact with a priest who returned to Paris in mid-February and tested positive for the virus last week.On Monday, an internal letter leaked to the press was sent to the staff at the ministry, saying the ministry employee was in isolation but ""is well and showing no symptoms"".Vatican experts said fear over the virus in the tiny city state was particularly acute because many residents were elderly.Among those most at risk is retired ex-pope Benedict XVI, 92, who lives in a small former monastery inside the Vatican.Benedict in 2013 became the first pope in 600 years to resign, citing health reasons.The Swiss Guards, who control those who come in and out of the Vatican and move around its grounds, have tightened checks at its five gates and reduced access to Benedict's home, the Stampa daily said.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

359,NMC’s Shetty looks to sell pharma business,"DUBAI :NMC Health Plc founder Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty is considering selling his Abu Dhabi-based pharmaceuticals business, Neopharma, after drawing interest from potential investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Shetty, who resigned as chairman of the troubled hospital operator last month, has been approached by parties, including regional investors and family offices, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Neopharma could be valued at between $700 million and $1 billion, they said.The Indian entrepreneur, who left over concerns that he may have misreported the size of his stake in NMC, may sell all or part of Neopharma and use the proceeds to repay loans, the people said.Talks are in preliminary stages and Shetty may decide not to proceed, they said. Neopharma operates in about 50 countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.A spokesman for Shetty’s BRS Ventures, which holds 30 companies including NMC and financial services firm Finablr Plc., declined to comment.Shetty is working with Houlihan Lokey Inc. to explore strategic options for BRS Ventures after NMC became entangled in allegations of fraud.Shetty had been considering selling shares in Neopharma before a December report by short seller Carson Block alleged NMC had overpaid for assets, inflated cash balances and understated debt.Since then, the hospital operator has lost two-thirds of its value and five of 11 board members have either been fired or resigned amid a series of financial improprieties.On Monday, NMC asked lenders for a reprieve on its debt. Meanwhile, Moody’s Investors Service slashed its rating by five levels, saying its financial statements can’t be relied on.bloomberg"
360,Parent Indian Railways’ land sale plan adds to Concor’s near-term woes,"The prospect of a strategic disinvestment and a shift in management control to the private sector generally fans optimism. Not so at Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor). Its stock has dropped 14% since 20 November when the government gave in-principle approval for a strategic divestment in the company. During the time the Nifty 500 index lost just 5%.Part of the losses can be explained by the deterioration in business environment. Volume growth at the state-run logistics solutions provider came to a standstill in the December quarter. While container volumes improved at major ports in January, sustainability of this recovery remains uncertain. The outbreak of the coronavirus and the impact on trade is seen as a major headwind.Adding to the near-term uncertainty is disinvestment- related transactions.Concor has deep interlinkages with its parent Indian Railways. Many of the company’s facilities are based on land leased from the railways, often at concessional rates. According to a report in The Hindu Business Line, the government plans to direct Concor to purchase railway land on which its facilities are located. The company may have to pay as much as  ₹8,000 crore for the land, points out the report.On the face of it, the move underscores the government’s resolve to proceed with the stake sale. But it can also be aimed at shoring up Indian Railways’ finances. Weak financial condition is forcing the railways to collect advance haulage charges from large customers such as Concor and NTPC Ltd.(Graphic: Satish Kumar/Mint) Transfer of the land can help the railways garner additional cash. “Note that in the past year, Concor and NTPC had boosted the cash position of Indian Railways by paying advance rail haulage charges,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.But such a transaction can load Concor with debt and reduce its appeal for a prospective buyer. Currently, the firm is estimated to incur land licence fee of  ₹200 crore annually. Land acquisition at circle rates will raise costs.Recovery of additional expenses through tariff hikes in a competitive environment can be tough. Further, tariff hikes in the recent past at several terminals limit the scope for more such increases. “The new owner would want to re-price the container freight offering higher (to compensate for the debt related interest costs); this could have possible impact on volumes given high sensitivity of pricing to volumes,"" said Antique Stock Broking Ltd in a note.Absorption of additional costs without commensurate tariff hikes can hurt profitability. On the positive side, the transaction will pave the way for the strategic divestment, which can help Concor realize its full potential. But a lot depends on the government pursuing this, the price at which this land is transferred and how the firm funds this investment."
361,Why SpiceJet’s shares are indifferent to declining global crude oil prices,"Crude oil prices are game changers for aviation companies’ fortunes. That’s because fuel forms a big chunk of an airline’s operating costs. However, the recent drop in crude prices has not helped SpiceJet Ltd’s shares take off. So far in 2020, Brent Crude prices have declined by 19%. At the same time, the SpiceJet stock has fallen by 34%. What explains?For one, the coronavirus outbreak is expected to hit travel demand, resulting in lower passenger loads on international flights. Airlines across the board are expected to suffer owing to the outbreak and as such SpiceJet is not an exception.According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, the international air route mix is 25% in SpiceJet, making it susceptible to the coronavirus outbreak.Sure, the international portfolio of bigger rival, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo, too is at risk. But the InterGlobe stock has declined at a relatively smaller pace of about 8% so far in 2020.Analysts attribute the sharp drop in SpiceJet’s shares to its comparatively weaker financial health. “Sentiments for the stock have not been great after the worse than expected financial performance for the nine month ended December (9MFY20),"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.(Graphic: Satish Kumar/Mint) For 9M FY20, SpiceJet reported a loss of  ₹128 crore at a time when overall revenues increased by 44% year-on-year to  ₹9,494 crore. On the contrary, InterGlobe has eked out a profit in the same period. What’s more, SpiceJet has recognized nearly  ₹540 crore as compensation receivable from Boeing Co. during 9M FY20 for its 13 grounded Boeing 737 MAX planes. The airline is now looking at a mid-2020 timeline for the likely return of the 737 MAX into service.Needless to say, any delay in receiving compensation from Boeing remains a risk. “The uncertainty over the timeline for resumption of MAX operations is clouding profitability at a time when the sector is facing demand headwinds due to the slowing economy—pricing shows no signs of improvement despite the consolidation in the sector,"" said analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd in a 14 February report.In the December quarter, SpiceJet’s yields, a pricing measure for airlines, had fallen by 7% year-on-year. Analysts expect yields to remain under pressure from a near-term perspective. Additionally, demand outlook is not rosy. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, passengers carried by domestic airlines grew just 2.2% in January from a year ago.As such, lower crude oil prices can only help to an extent when demand is muted. In this backdrop, the drop in the SpiceJet stock suggests investors are factoring the headwinds adequately."
362,How much tax do you pay on debt investments?,"Any portfolio should have a balanced mix of asset classes. Diversification helps reduce the overall risk. For instance, equity investments tend to give higher returns than all other asset classes over the long run, but they are also riskier. To balance that, one must invest in debt-related products. While these too carry some risk, they are considered safer. Also pay heed to the taxation rules to know what the net returns would be.

363,Xerox starts tender offer in hostile takeover bid for HP,"SAN FRANCISCO :Xerox Holdings Corp. has started a tender offer for all outstanding shares of HP Inc., escalating a battle for control of the personal computer giant that Xerox executives began considering almost 10 months ago. Xerox has pitched HP investors on a cash-and-stock offer worth $24 a share. For each HP share, a holder would receive $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares. The offer is set to expire 21 April, Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox said Monday in a statement.The photocopying pioneer has said combining the companies would yield $2 billion in cost savings and more than $1 billion in additional revenue growth. Both hardware companies invented technologies still in use by consumers and office workers, and have struggled in a world increasingly driven by software.HP’s board has rejected Xerox’s offer as undervaluing the Palo Alto, California-based company, and said last week it will return $16 billion to shareholders in an effort to show it can stand on its own. HP executives, however, said they will engage Xerox to discuss a potential combination on their terms.“Our proposal offers progress over entrenchment,"" Xerox chief executive officer John Visentin said in the statement. “HP shareholders will receive $27 billion in immediate, upfront cash while retaining significant, long-term upside through equity ownership in a combined company with greater free cash flow to invest in growth and return to shareholders.""On Monday, HP said in a statement that it will review Xerox’s offer over 10 business days before advising the best course of action for shareholders.Xerox executives first contemplated an acquisition of HP in May 2019, the company said in a regulatory filing. After acquiring a 4% stake in HP, Xerox’s largest shareholder, activist Carl Icahn, called Visentin and HP’s then-CEO on 12 August to say that a merger of the companies would create value.Executives from Xerox and HP met on 12 September to discuss due diligence. HP officials “indicated they had reservations about"" a deal with Xerox because of challenges integrating the Samsung print business that HP bought in 2017, limitations on HP conducting business in China and undisclosed restrictions contained in HP’s agreements with Canon Inc. HP sent Xerox a long list of questions, including requests for information that Xerox found “competitively sensitive"".Xerox refused to answer them without a confidentiality agreement and mutual due diligence. Xerox’s board decided executives shouldn’t engage in discussions with HP or open the company’s books unless the PC maker proposed a deal structure or gave Xerox access for due diligence. Instead, the printing company redoubled efforts to put together an offer to buy HP, which it sent 5 November.Xerox said it has secured financing from Citigroup Inc., Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., PNC Bank, Credit Agricole, Truist Financial Corp. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. for the cash portion of the offer."
364,"Gold prices today surge  ₹1,200 per 10 gram, silver rates soar","Gold prices in India surged today, tracking a global rally after US Fed announced an emergency rate cut to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus outbreak. Gold also got a boost from a weaker rupee. On MCX, gold futures rose nearly 3% or about  ₹1,200 per gram to  ₹43,149 per 10 gram. Silver futures on MCX also soared 3% or  ₹1,300 per kg to  ₹46,307. Falling for the third consecutive session, the rupee today slumped 43 paise to close at a 16-month low of 73.29 against the US dollar as investor sentiment remained fragile amid concerns over the impact of coronavirus, and rising crude oil prices.Global rates, rupee dollar exchange rate and import duty (currently at 12.5%) determine the domestic price of gold. GST at the rate of 3% is also levied on gold purchases.In global markets, gold prices surged over 3% today after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates to help cushion the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Spot gold climbed 2.8% to $1,634.50 an ounce after rates soared as much as 3.3% earlier in the session. Among other precious metals, silver jumped 3.4% to $17.29 and platinum climbed 1.6% to $873.77 per ounce.Analysts said the rate cut should support gold prices, at least short term and expectations of further action by more action by other central banks.The Fed's move came after Group of Seven finance officials said earlier in the day that they would use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable global growth and safeguard against downside risks posed by the fast-spreading coronavirus.Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. It also weighs on US yields and the dollar, making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies. The dollar index fell 0.4% to its lowest in nearly 2 months against a basket of currencies.Gold could be poised for further gains once governments announce the details to the major fiscal stimulus response, said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker OANDA, in a note, according to news agency Reuters.

365,Sharp surge in Ipca Lab’s stock prices a much-faster growth pace,"Ipca Laboratories Ltd’s focus on branded generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have distinguished its business from other Indian drug makers. When adverse moves by the US Food and Drug Administration, and issues such as the coronavirus epidemic slam domestic pharma firms, APIs and domestic formulations are seen as sub-segments with better growth sustainability. Nevertheless, investors may be pricing in a much rapid growth, as the Ipca Laboratories’ stock has surged about 76% in just a year.After the coronavirus epidemic surfaced, the API business seems to be one of the draws for investors as firms seek to diversify sourcing from outside China. With 25% of its revenues coming from APIs, Ipca Laboratories has a long way to go in this business. In FY20 so far, its API revenues have grown 33%, which is a good growth rate.The company is expanding its API manufacturing facilities for which it acquired Noble Explochem Ltd, and more land. Ipca Laboratories wants to spend about  ₹400 crore as capital expenditure on these plants. But the benefits from these plants will accrue only after FY22.(Graphic: Naveen Kumar Saini/Mint) Another positive is the fact that Ipca Laboratories does not have to rely too heavily on third-party API sourcing. The drug maker produces about 55% of its API requirements in-house. The coronavirus epidemic will not impact sourcing of APIs also, as the company holds raw material inventory for the next two-three months.A strong domestic formulations business also provides the requisite diversification. Growth in this segment has been on expected lines at about 15% year-on-year in the December quarter. Nevertheless, with about 27% of its domestic business under price control, Ipca Laboratories needs to expand into other therapies to keep its margin profile stronger.Lower reliance on the US for growth as compared to the rest of the world augurs well. As such, its exports were growing at a pace of 25% in Q3.Nevertheless, some of these positives have driven the Ipca Laboratories stock up in the recent past, taking it to a price-earnings multiple of 29.3 times its trailing 12-month earnings. At this price, its stock seems overpriced from the value of the company."

367,Opinion | This is now a public health emergency,"It has taken a slew of sudden cases of suspected Covid-19 infection in various parts of India for the government to wake up to the potential catastrophe that its contagion poses. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he had reviewed India’s preparedness to tackle Covid-19. By doing so, he has flagged the illness as a top concern. Hopefully, this should spur various organs of the administration to swing into action against an outbreak. The government’s response until now had seemed ostrich-like, almost as if looking away from a looming crisis would keep it away. Most of the measures taken so far have been focused on business. In response to a Chinese supply cut-off, the Centre imposed export restrictions on 26 pharmaceutical ingredients. This is not just about factories shut down, commerce disrupted and travel plans put off, though. This is about health. As the virus fans out, what is needed is a nationwide alert and set of protocols to keep people out of harm’s way. Apart from Delhi, cities such as Bengaluru and Agra began flashing red on the risk map on Tuesday. How much further it goes is anybody’s guess, but patterns in other countries suggest that it may be a long while before Indians feel safe. Panic must not take hold. To ensure this, it is imperative for the Centre to formulate a containment strategy, engage citizens on the menace, and issue clear guidelines. Communication will play a key role. Ever since the epidemic first erupted in China, it was feared that the rest of the world would not be able to escape exposure. That is exactly how it has turned out. At last count, the virus had spread to 70 countries. While some are hit more than others, with Italy, South Korea, Japan, and Iran reeling under the impact of Covid-19, it is now obvious that every government around the globe must push its healthcare system into battle mode against what is fast acquiring pandemic status. India is no exception. Some had assumed that warmer places were somehow safer. While it is true that colder cities have suffered more, such talk does little other than add to the complacency that appears to have prevailed all these weeks. If anything, India’s creaky healthcare apparatus would make the country all the more vulnerable to Covid-19. Other factors such as population density and illiteracy do not offer much comfort either. Unless the government has quietly run training camps for health professionals, marked out and made space for special wards, acquired test kits in vast quantities, and stockpiled protective suits, medicines and other materials, it is likely that our public health infrastructure will be quickly overwhelmed by a groundswell of infections, should it come to that.Perhaps it’s not too late to learn from countries that quickly restricted the virus to just a few early cases. Singapore is said to have taken exemplary measures. It adopted extensive surveillance and contact-tracing methods to detect and quarantine suspected and confirmed cases. Some of that may not be replicable in a country as big as India, but what proved most effective was how citizens and businesses were kept in the loop with advisories, notices and updates. All of it was part of a coordinated campaign calibrated to maximize safety and minimize economic disruption. No two nations are alike. However, the basic principles are the same. It takes the cooperation of people and earning their trust means reaching out."
368,The flawed concept of demonetization,"Mumbai: It is evident that the decision to implement demonetization was thrust upon the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the ATMs ran out of cash while rules and notifications regarding withdrawals and deposits changed frequently, says Amartya Lahiri, economist and former head of RBI think-tank Centre For Advanced Financial Research And Learning (Cafral), in his new study. The research, which has added to the growing consensus about the failure of demonetization, uses data from different sources to highlight the disruption the reform has caused.The fact that demonetization had limited impact on its stated goals is proof that it was poorly conceptualized, says Lahiri, who is currently professor at the University of British Columbia.The most important goal of demonetization was to purge India of black money, but that did not happen as over 99% of demonetized currency returned to the banking system. Demonetization was also meant to bring more people under the tax net and drive up tax revenue. However, this effect was muted as both direct and indirect tax saw no marked deviation from its past trends. Neither did demonetization have a significant impact on digitization and counterfeit currency. Demonetization may have been successful in pushing up the number of digital transactions, but the value of transactions has not changed significantly.In the short-run, demonetization hurt economic activity. Even after the additional deposits from demonetization, bank credit did not pick up. Similarly, labour market data also suggests that around 15 million people exited the labour force during this period. These effects could have been negated slightly with better conceptualization, the research suggests. The author argues that demonetizing just the  ₹1,000 currency notes could have been less disruptive.Also read: The Great Indian DemonetizationSnap Fact features new and interesting reads from the world of research."
369,Delhi HC seeks response from Centre on plea seeking uniform road tax,"New Delhi: The Delhi High court on Tuesday sought response from Centre on a plea seeking a policy on uniform road tax for the private vehicles all over India. The plea also seeks direction to Centre to keep a unified online database for vehicles registered all over India so that if a vehicle registered at the RTO office of one state get registered in another state, the lifetime road tax paid in previous state may automatically be paid by the previous state to the new state.The petition is filed by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Deepak Bajpai.“...if anyone shifts to another city with a personal vehicle, the owner is required to re-register the vehicle; this involves getting a no-objection certificate from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) where the vehicle was originally registered, repaying tax in the newer place, and getting a new vehicle number,"" the plea reads.This plea said that as per Section 47 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the vehicle owner has to seek a new registration mark for motor vehicles under new Transport Authority in case the vehicle is transferred to a new state and kept for more than 12 months after taking No objection from the RTO of the previous state.This further entails payment of one road tax again to the new state irrespective of the fact that the vehicle owner had already paid onetime road tax in the earlier state, it said“This regulatory requirement of making people change their vehicle registration when there is a change in address exists as different States have different tax structures for vehicles. The idea is to discourage people from buying vehicles from those States where the taxes are lower, making the vehicle cheaper. Hence a Uniform road tax for the private vehicles all over India is a dire need in order to prevent harassment of those who due to bonafide personal or professional reasons shift to other states,"" it further added.“It is submitted that the Uniform road tax will discourage buyers to get their vehicles other than their home states that have the comparatively lower rate of one-time road tax,"" the plea said."
370,Opinion | Platform technologies could deliver a vaccine quickly,"Since late last year, Covid-19 has been spreading rapidly throughout the world. As of last week, it has infected over 86,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,000. The virus is transmitted through air, in the tiny respiratory droplets that infected people produce when they talk and breathe, so much so that even before they start displaying symptoms, they are already spreading the disease. Coronaviruses are a family of pathogens that cause respiratory illness. They transmit rapidly and frequently evolve into new variants not previously identified in humans. While at least four strains cause very mild infections every year with symptoms and outcomes no different from those of the common cold, there have been several dangerous variants. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, better known as SARS-CoV, killed 774 people in 2003, and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV, has a mortality rate of 35%.So far, the primary method used to halt the spread of this disease has been active containment. China, situated as it is at the epicentre of the outbreak, reacted aggressively, locking down entire cities to prevent the disease from travelling. In Europe and elsewhere, people were advised to work from home and avoid gathering in public, while conferences around the world were cancelled and employees advised not to travel overseas unless absolutely necessary.These measures have had some success in slowing the spread in and from China but were never going to halt disease transmission completely. Today, the virus has spread throughout the world and if any country is presently not affected by the disease, health officials are saying that it is probably just a matter of time before it will be. And while there is every chance that the spread of the virus will peak and then die down, if we can develop an effective vaccine that halts the disease in its tracks, everyone will breathe easier.The trouble with vaccine development is that it is expensive, fraught with financial risk and opportunity cost for the pharmaceutical industry. A single vaccine could cost over a billion dollars to develop, which is why only one that is routinely administered to large segments of a population is ever going to be financially viable. Vaccines for infectious diseases of the kind that are critical for epidemic and pandemic preparedness are the most risky class of vaccines to invest in. They have to be produced in advance, even though there is no immediate market for their use. What’s worse, they have to be produced in large volumes so that when the need arises, they are available in sufficient quantities to prove useful.Vaccines have longer development lead times than ordinary drugs since they have more stringent approval processes. Unlike ordinary drugs, they have to be administered to healthy people, which means that the margin of safety has to be high. As the later stages of vaccine trials involve field studies, the logistical challenges of refrigeration and transport often complicate the approval process.In emergencies such as this one, the delay that a heavy regulatory burden imposes on the availability of viable vaccines could have serious consequences. In 2009, though we had developed a vaccine for the H1N1 virus, by the time it was manufactured and delivered, the peak of viral activity had passed. In situations where the rapid deployment of a viable vaccine is our only hope of slowing down a global pandemic, we need to have alternative methods to develop solutions.Pharmaceutical companies have been working on developing platform technologies for vaccines that could significantly accelerate the developmental cycle. Simply put, a platform vaccine is a system that uses certain basic components as the backbone but which can be adapted relatively quickly —by inserting new genetic or protein sequences—so that it can be used against different pathogens. Because of this flexible design, these platforms can be set up for rapid use against novel pathogens. Since they can be used for both emerging as well as routine infectious diseases, they have the welcome side effect of also being a means by which pharmaceutical companies can achieve economies of scale, thereby lowering commercial risk.The problem is that under the current legal regime, regulators are set up to approve products, not platforms. They currently only know how to evaluate vaccines that are intended for human use and simply do not have the tools with which to evaluate the efficacy of products developed using platform technologies. Regulators need to better understand how these platforms work and get comfortable with letting manufacturer reference prior approvals inherent in these platforms as a means to accelerate the approval of a final product. For instance, when the platform is a cell line that allows viral proteins to be expressed, it could be prequalified by the regulator so that the time-consuming steps that are necessary for regulatory approvals do not have to be repeated each time that cell line is used in other vaccines.It will take time for regulators to gain sufficient experience with vaccines manufactured using platform technologies. But once they do, pharmaceutical companies will be able to move vaccines developed to combat epidemics rapidly through several stages of the mandatory clinical trials.This might be too late for Covid-19, but at least we will be better prepared for the next pandemic.Rahul Matthan is a partner at Trilegal and author of ‘Privacy 3.0: Unlocking Our Data Driven Future’"
371,Opinion | Only Modi can end the climate of mistrust that prevails today,"Good politics may not always make for good economics and vice versa, for political and economic timetables may not coincide. However, there has never been a better time than now to align the two. The disruption of global supply chains because of the spread of Covid-19, the crises in several key sectors such as telecom, power, realty, and non-bank finance, and the fiscal constraints under which these problems have to be tackled clearly indicate that the Narendra Modi government has to focus 100% on getting the economy out of its ditch. However, you can’t lift the economy without lifting your politics. The economy will take longer to revive if the political climate worsens, as seems likely after the Delhi riots. The over-played protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, have fuelled a sharp breakdown of community trust, and political temperatures are rising.One man can single-handedly change this scenario if he commits himself to it: Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Post-May 2019, Modi has let home minister Amit Shah take centre stage to steer politically sensitive legislative changes involving Article 370, triple talaq, and CAA, even as he himself has focused on the economy along with the finance minister. Given the mistrust generated in the business community in his first term, Modi has recently begun emphasizing his support for wealth creators and entrepreneurship, which is a good course correction.However, there is one missing element. There is a gap between political messaging and action. One example: As part of the trust-building exercise with businesses, the 2020-21 budget launched a Vivad se Vishwas scheme to let direct tax cases pending in various appellate forums be settled by waiving penalties and interest on the original tax demand. However, the message given to tax officials is that they must get all parties on board for a settlement, which means the former will not merely nudge people to settle, but coerce them. News reports suggest that even some public sector companies such as Life Insurance Corp. of India are not amused that they are being asked to meet demands that they never saw as fair in the first place. The scheme may need further tweaks, where even the original demand can be adjusted through a compromise figure, or withdrawn after quick arbitration. Without this leeway, the scheme will generate more mistrust among businesses than trust.So, whether it is politics or economics or ties with India Inc., the primary task facing Modi is the removal of mistrust.It would help if the Prime Minister along with the finance minister were to meet various groups of businessmen, representatives of sectors in distress, small and medium enterprises, and big businesses, once a month so that he directly gets to hear of the problems they face and provide the necessary political direction for resolution.The bigger challenges are political. Factor market and agricultural reforms are impossible without getting states on board, but this is not happening as the Opposition is not on talking terms with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Prime Minister can break this vicious cycle of mistrust by making such adroit political moves that states would have to sign up. For example, he could offer a deal so that they stop opposing the humanitarian CAA law in return for accepting their proposals on the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens.A more important deal to offer would involve the devolution of power and resources to states and local bodies. The Prime Minister should call a meeting of chief ministers and offer to set up a constitutional committee to re-examine the concurrent list so that more subjects are shifted to states and cities, and more fiscal resources devolved to them. No state can oppose this, especially if the panel to recommend changes has strong voices from non-BJP states.Two other incentives that the Centre could offer states to align with it on growth goals are a transfer of most food and fertilizer subsidies to states, provided they promise not to mindlessly offer farm loan waivers. Also, the fiscal cap for states can be raised from 3% of gross domestic product to 3.25% or 3.5%, again provided this is used only for investment in infrastructure.Eliminating Centre-state mistrust is vital even for reforms already legislated, such as changes in the Apprentices Act and fixed-term labour contracts. States have not moved forward on these reforms and most micro, small and medium enterprises do not even know that they can hire apprentices at low cost or give fixed-term contracts to workers.The Indian reality is this: 58-60% of government expenditure is incurred at the state level, so states need to be the driving force of the economy. However, this cannot happen unless Centre-state relations are on an even keel and Modi’s outreach has to focus on mending the equations.If mistrust between the Centre and states, between government and business, and between tax assessee and assessor has to end, the directive for it must come from the top. Modi’s own hold on power depends on what he does politically, for the economy could partly fix itself if politics runs smoothly.R. Jagannathan is editorial director, ‘Swarajya’ magazine"
372,Opinion | The house that Jack Welch (1935-2020) built is no more,"Jack Welch, General Electric, GE former CEO, corporate management, Jack Welch corporate philosophy Jack Welch died on Monday. However, the Jack Welch way of doing business had died long before that. In the brutally competitive world of business today, nothing lasts forever. Not even a company that for most of its 128 years in business was considered the gold standard in corporate excellence. Then, just like that, one of the original 12 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average was unceremoniously dropped from the index in June 2018.Almost 40 years ago, when Welch, armed with a doctorate in chemical engineering, took over as chief executive officer (CEO) of General Electric, it was valued at $14 billion. He proceeded to yank it out of the mediocrity it had slipped into despite its history of innovation and research. By 1999, GE was worth $400 billion and Welch was hailed as a masterclass at work, an alpha CEO who inspired management tomes. His corporate philosophy was based on the principles of optimizing operational efficiencies at all costs, and in its execution, he was ruthless. Even though he did say that it was his effort to “create the informality of a corner neighbourhood grocery store in the soul of a big company"", GE under him never did become that genial, benevolent employer. For most employees, it was a company where the pressure to perform or perish was the norm. The result was that GE became the most influential company in the world admired and feared by friends and foes alike.In the seeds of its success, though, lurked the weeds of future turmoil. In 2001, Welch stepped down as chairman, Al Qaeda wreaked havoc on New York, and the world changed forever. The powerful industrial juggernauts of the 1980s looked wobbly as a whole new generation of businessmen and -women started writing a different textbook of strategy and management. That today’s trillion-dollar market cap companies, such as Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, bear little resemblance to the ideal Welch corporation tells the story of changing times.GE’s decline, first a slip, then a slide and in recent years an avalanche, began with its ill-fated and ill-timed rush into financial services. The crisis of 2008 may have precipitated its woes, but in truth, the very structure of the modern American corporation that Welch had so assiduously laid was now found to be suspect. That year, the company’s stock crashed 42% as the folly of its unbridled expansion played out. While the horror show came under the watch of his successor Jeffrey Immelt, its roots lay in acquisitions under Welch as he sought to build a super-conglomerate. GE Capital for instance, a trademark no-holds-barred Welch diversification, became so big under his successors that its woes in 2008 almost brought the entire company to its knees. Welch’s big plan to extend the company into any area where it could be among the top two in terms of market share created a sprawling empire. As a 2018 piece in Bloomberg Businessweek put it, “It manufactured consumer products and industrial machinery, powered commercial airliners and nuclear submarines, produced radar altimeters and romantic comedies."" (bloom.bg/3ar4KXV)It was altogether too good to last, and it was Welch who would have to cop much of the blame. Eventually, his method of maximizing profits by minimizing costs and choosing physical assets over people collapsed. Welch, the darling of Wall Street, manager of managers, found that corporate Darwinism could take you only so far.For all of GE’s present woes, we must remain mindful of Welch’s legacy. At its peak, his influence extended far and wide. Indian business, in particular, owes a huge debt to the man, for it was he who first identified the potential of India’s IT industry. In the 1980s, this was no more than a small enclave of budding entrepreneurs with no inkling of the vast, globally dominant multibillion-dollar industry that it is today. Displaying vision and foresight, Welch put his money where his mouth was, and as GE started outsourcing its IT back-end needs to firms such as Wipro, Infosys, and TCS, a country hitherto considered the backwaters of technology took its first ambitious steps on the world stage. Today, GE is believed to outsource nearly $10 billion of IT services to companies in India.Welch made friends too. Azim Premji, entrepreneur and philanthropist par excellence, was one of them. GE’s emphasis on quality and corporate governance resonated with him, and the two did business together with GE becoming Wipro’s joint venture partner in medical devices and one of its earliest clients for IT services. He wasn’t the only one. Sam Pitroda was the man who advised Welch to look at Indian software in the first place. To his credit, Welch did more than just look at it. Business followed, but more than that, Welch’s single-minded focus on the bottomline served as an important lesson for Indian business leaders such as N.R. Narayana Murthy.Through the 1990s, as Indian business searched for its metier in a newly liberalized economic environment, GE became the go-to model for many companies. Middle management, that bane of corporations in the US through the 1970s, had felt the power of Welch’s wrath. In India, as family businesses turned inwards, they found similar sloth impeding progress. Bloated corporate bureaucracies were dismantled and what emerged were leaner and meaner companies that could compete globally.Jack Welch will be missed, but his management philosophy had long run its course.Sundeep Khanna is former executive editor of Mint"
373,Opinion | It may be time for the country to set up a national risk office,"The rapid spread of Covid-19 across the world shows that a networked world has to face networked risks. What happens in one part of the world can quickly spill over to other parts of the world. Such contagion is not unique to our times, but the challenge is more acute now than ever before. This is perhaps a good time to reiterate an idea that this column touched upon many years ago—that countries need to think about risk just as companies do. The big difference is that governments have to deal with systemic risks that are beyond the scope of the risk management practices of individual companies. And that is also why they are important.Consider two examples in the Indian context. First, the Indian government maintains substantial food stocks as insurance against a sudden shock to food production. Second, the Reserve Bank of India maintains foreign exchange reserves to protect the economy against a balance of payments crisis.These should be seen as insurance against extreme events such as a monsoon failure or a sudden stop in foreign capital inflows respectively. Insurance comes at a cost. Both the maintenance of food stocks as well as foreign exchange reserves impose fiscal costs on the Indian government. There are also broader risk management initiatives such as the stress testing of financial institutions to see how they can withstand shocks.Supply chains can disperse risk or aggregate it. The Covid-19 shock has once again brought risks that emanate from supply chain concentration into focus. For example, paracetamol prices in India have already shot up because of a shutdown in the Hubei province of China, which is the hub of global manufacturing of bulk drugs. This is not the first time this has happened. Semiconductor prices shot up across the world after an earthquake in Taiwan in 1999. An earthquake in Japan in 2011 combined with floods in Thailand at the same time put auto component supplies under pressure for some time.The World Economic Forum made a suggestion in its Global Risks 2007 report that needs a fresh airing. It said countries should appoint country risk officers who take a broader view of nationwide risks. Any country faces myriad risks—from cyber warfare to climate change to supply chain disruptions to energy security to financial crises to social fissures. It is very unlikely that a single risk tsar can do the job. A better option would be to have a national risk office that coordinates risk assessment initiatives among different parts of the government. The design of such an office could perhaps be something that a think tank such as the NITI Aayog needs to think about.Consider the example of climate change. Many coastal Indian cities could be at risk in case sea levels rise as rapidly as some scientists predict. The task of governments at all levels is then not just to mount a quick emergency response, but also to think of redesigning cities right now based on risk assessments for the future. A national risk office—or a federal network of such offices—would have to measure risks, design incentives that change how cities are built, and plan for emergencies. Something similar will have to be done for other nationwide risks.The implicit problem in thinking about risks at the national level is that wrong calls can impose large costs on society. For example, the risk from supply chain disruptions does not mean that countries should withdraw into protectionist shells. It would be akin to deciding not to cross the road because of the risk of being hit by a speeding car. Global production chains have been very efficient, but they could grind to a halt if even one part of the chain breaks. Last week, this column had drawn parallels with the O-Ring problem, when the sophisticated Challenger space shuttle had burst into flames because a minor component had malfunctioned.Most companies think hard about risk management. Few governments do. The potential of Covid-19 to disrupt global supplies, combined with the unpreparedness of governments, raises important questions of public policy. As in the private sector, there will always be a tricky choice between risk and return, or between economic efficiency and economic security. These are choices that need to be made by elected governments, though guided by something like a national risk office.A few years ago, during policy debates when the 12th Five Year Plan was being finalized, Montek Singh Ahluwalia wrote in an essay: “We can consciously choose a strategy which entails a lower level of risk and therefore possibly lower reward…or we can aim at a higher reward strategy combined with conscious measures of risk management, to be able to deal with unfavourable outcomes should they arise."" He was mostly referring to economic policy choices, but these words apply to a lot of other government policies as well.Niranjan Rajadhyaksha is a member of the academic board of the Meghnad Desai Academy of Economics"
374,The generation of precrastinators,"Maithili Appalwar, 23, is moving at a breakneck speed to grow her Mumbai-based startup, Avana, an agro-technology social enterprise. To do this, her aim is to complete multiple to-do lists (quarterly, weekly and daily) and ensure she reaches inbox zero, which means every email she gets needs to be answered, snoozed or filed away by the end of the day. “If I don’t finish everything on my list, I get anxious,"" she says. Appalwar is a self-confessed precrastinator. Opposite of procrastinators, precrastinators are people who finish tasks earlier than expected. They answer emails immediately, turn in work ahead of deadlines, get medical lab tests done as soon as a window opens for it, pay bills immediately and complete their to-do lists before time. Take, Arjun Bajaj, 25, who runs a TV technology startup in Delhi, for instance. Every Sunday he has a checklist ready for the week ahead. “I believe in being ready sooner than needed, even at the cost of my sleep or life,"" says Bajaj, adding that it helps him stay focused and productive.THE SCIENCE OF ITDavid Rosenbaum, distinguished professor, (psychology), at the University of California, coined the term “precrastination"" in 2014, and has since been researching on it.“In our studies we observed that precrastinators have a cognitive benefit as completing tasks ahead of time reduces load on working memory, reducing anxiety,"" he says.It’s also good if you are ambitious. As competition increases, aspiration and ambition causes the millennial and post-millennial generations to continue their hurtle towards being over-achievers in their careers. Being a precrastinator helps.It’s not only beats stress, but is also good for realizing your goals, says Saagar Panchal, 25, a startup founder based in Mumbai. “Completing tasks ahead of time reduces my physical and mental stress because it makes me happy that I’m finishing my work faster,"" he says. This reflects when Panchal has to deal with unexpected situations or meetings.On the other hand, since Bajaj is always multitasking, being a precrastinator helps him react to wrong moves faster. “It’s very easy to anticipate a problem if you are organized and can think beforehand,"" he says.Since running a startup can be demanding, planning ahead and finishing tasks early can give you enough time to think about future activities, and react or polish previous tasks.“I read, learn new things, and look for new opportunities,"" says Aayushi Lakhapati, 28, co-founder of 23BMI, a healthcare startup. Lakhapati, who is based in Mumbai, is always on top of her mundane tasks. She prepares her meals in advance, pays bills as soon as they reach her table and always has a suitcase packed for a business trip.As a startup founder, she believes being a precrastinator improves her overall productivity.THERE’S ALWAYS A DOWNSIDEBeing a precrastinator can help you stay ahead of things, but it can also affect your personal life and health.Azaan Feroz Sait, 26, founder of startup Safrina Ventures, says it could lead to putting yourself and your team under unnecessary pressure.“In today’s connected world, I find being responsive to all the notifications quite stressful,"" says Sait, who also precrastinates.Since he leads a team, he has consciously decided to set boundaries, so there is a semblance of work-life balance.Though the speed has helped Appalwar keep abreast with changes, strategize and grow her business, it has also affected her mental health.“I get really anxious if I have a down day at work,"" she says, adding that if she has less work on her table, she wonders if there’s something wrong. Similar is the case with Lakhapati.A month ago, she received an email from a client in the middle of the night. Though she did not respond right away, she had a disturbed night. “Responding was the first thing I did after I woke up,"" she says.Being a precrastinator definitely has an advantage. You finish work faster and can do more in your time. However, you should lookout for signs that say it’s chronic, warns Prof Rosenbaum as this tendency can easily turn people into slaves of their work.“Chronic personalities fear that if they don’t respond immediately to emails or calls or text messages, they will be punished and, as a result, they spend less time with family, friends,"" he says.Rasesh Seth, 29, a startup founder based in Mumbai, went through something similar. He responded to work emails at night during his honeymoon. “It was an extremely stressful situation, a critical project,"" he says. This went on for four days and he feels that because he is a habituated precrastinator, he could not stop before his tasks finished.The best way to stop reaching chronic levels of precrastination is to chill, suggests Prof Rosenbaum. “Deliberately hold off on getting things done too soon and avoid being caught up in the endless game of mutual acceleration, being disliked by colleagues and clients and just relax,"" he says.Write to us at businessoflfie@livemint.com"
375,Filling up the tiffin ‘dabba’ for pets,"When Delhi’s Rashee Shah Kuchroo, 31, returned home after completing her business graduate degree in London in 2011, she was sad to see the health of her pet dog, Sloppy. His kibble diet had made him overweight and it was affecting the dog’s joints. Within the next few weeks, Kuchroo signed up for an online course to understand the kind of nutrition dogs require. Soon, Sloppy was put on a diet and when the results started showing, friends started approaching her to design vet-approved meal plans for their pets. That’s when she first contemplated a tiffin service for pets, called Doggie Dabbas, which today offers over 5,000 meals each month for animals in Delhi and Mumbai.“I was obsessed with dogs, but I never started out with a business in mind. Initially, we focussed solely on frozen foods; by 2014, customers wanted treats and snacks as well,"" Kuchroo says.Over the past few years, a number of startups are helping people access fresh meals for their pets. The services are ensuring a healthy lifestyle for the dogs while the pet parents try to strike a work-life balance.Pune’s Sonal Zalkikar, 43, was one such parent. Having worked in the information technology industry for over 15 years, her hectic schedule hardly left her any time to cook for her Labrador, Roxy. After her dog developed liver-related issues, Zalkikar consulted her vet and started learning recipes that could be cooked at home. “People want to give their dogs fresh food, but cannot do so due to a busy lifestyle. They are usually fed packaged food or basic meal of rice and milk or rotis. I also came across vegetarian families who didn’t want to deprive their dogs of meat. It gave me an idea; I started exploring if there would be any takers for a food service,"" she says.What started out as a sabbatical from the corporate world soon became an industry shift when Zalkikar started Pet Feast in 2017. After taking an online canine nutritionist course, she arrived at different offerings comprising vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals, besides catering to dogs that were allergic to certain ingredients or suffered any kind of ailments.The access to healthy meals has resulted in happy pet parents. Zalkikar worked with an overweight dog and helped her shed 5kg over a period of six months.Kuchroo took charge of a dog that the vet had recommended to be put to sleep because of health issues. “I changed the diet around six years ago, and the dog continues to be my client even today.""The Pet Club looks at millennials who are driving the petcare startup space.Write to us at businessoflife@livemint.com"

In their new book, The Amazon Management System: The Ultimate Digital Business Engine That Creates Extraordinary Value For Both Customers And Shareholders, they explain how most management systems are not focused on customers or innovation, but rather on achieving incremental growth and gaining market share. The book explains the six building blocks of the Amazon management system. Its customer-obsessed business model means it is able to defy traditional laws of diminishing returns. The talent pool is carefully defined and rigorously chosen, thereby raising the bar for both the talent pool and for the mechanism of talent acquisition and retention.

377,Bentley’s Bacalar doubles down on bespoke supercars,"NEW YORK :Organizers killed the Geneva Auto Show because of coronavirus fears, but had the show run, it would not have made any difference for aspirants to Bentley’s new grand tourer. The £1.5 million ($1.9 million) Bentley Bacalar, which had been set to debut as Bentley’s crown jewel at the annual car show, instead emerged via live video feed on the morning of 3 March. Bentley is making only 12 of them, each engineered to their individual owner’s taste. They have already sold out. But don’t despair. A roomy two-seater with a 650-bhp W12 engine, Bacalar is just the first of what will be a new portfolio of cars sprung from a nascent division at Bentley called Mulliner Coachbuilt. The new division is a logical move for the company that has said more than 90% of all its vehicles are customized.It’s joining arch-nemesis Rolls-Royce in strengthening its in-house bespoke division, but they’re not the only ones to capitalize on the luxury market’s appetite for individuality. Aston Martin has a similar in-house bespoke program, called Q by Aston Martin; even Porsche has expanded its longtime Exclusive Manufaktur customization program based in Zuffenhausen, Germany, to coincide with the launch of the Taycan.Bespoke BacalarThe new Bacalar doubles as a marketing device that hints at the capabilities of the 40 artisans at the Crewe, England-based Mulliner shop. It shows that those workers can conjure delightful automotive elements from raw materials such as local wool, ancient river wood, and even rice—the paint on the Bacalar comes from the ash of rice husks, a sustainable way to achieve a rich metallic finish on the exterior of your sublimely exclusive coach.The exterior of the all-wheel-drive, eight-speed Bacalar is defined by its wide stance, clamshell rear, and Barchetta, or roofless, body. It’s a polarizing style but one that comes by its design honestly: It shares no construction or panels with any other vehicle at Bentley and instead—with its protruding front nose, tall grille, and wraparound feel—summons the vibe of the EXP 100 GT concept car the company showed last year.There’s even the open-top feel of the Birkin Blower Bentley of the 1920s—the modern McLaren Elva, Porsche Speedster, and Ferrari Monza cars have this, too. About the only thing that the Bacalar does share with its Bentley brethren is a door handle, with keyless entry, like the one on the Continental GT.The interior displays a wraparound cockpit and semi-enclosed luggage compartment behind the seats. As you might expect, you can also purchase a set of luggage designed exclusively by Italian leather-goods maker Schedoni to fit inside the particular dimensions of the car.The Mulliner ConnectionBentley brass, along with leaders at archrival Rolls-Royce, have commented publicly about the vast margins available for hand-crafted, highly bespoke vehicles. The Mulliner division in particular derives from a long tradition of coachbuilding at Bentley, which uses the institutional memory and skills of a former saddle shop formerly run by the eponymous family and which has existed since the 1500s.The family rose to prominence in the 1760s for its work building and maintaining carriages for the Royal Mail postal service; in 1923, it created a bespoke two-seat Bentley for the 1923 Olympia Show in London, the first of more than 240 bespoke automobiles Mulliner created for Bentley during that decade.The two houses went on to create such famous cars as the 1952 R-Type Continental and formally merged in 1959. Now, Mulliner builds Bentley’s most exclusive vehicles like Bentaygas with picnic baskets inside and Flying Spurs that bear specific family crests and totems.But the Bacalar takes that concept a step further, whether it’s Beluga-colored leather seats or British woods or natural yarns for trimming textiles. You can also request the gear shifter be made in wood or metal or covered in carbon fiber, get leather door straps, request singular piping made by hand in a nearby countryside district, and have a unique-to-you analog clock in the dashboard. It will all be on high display, too, since the car comes without a top—everyone will be able to see each detail from the piping to the floor mats as the car passes by. Better make it good.The Geneva auto show was cancelled after the Swiss government put an immediate ban Friday on all public and private events involving more than 1,000 people in order to halt the spread of the new coronavirus. The ban on big events will last until at least 15 March, one of the latest major steps by governments to fight an outbreak that has infected more than 82,000 people and killed over 2,700 worldwide.The Swiss move highlights the growing impact of the virus on daily lives and livelihoods. The annual Geneva International Motor Show, which was due to run 5-15 March and draws tens of thousands of visitors every year, confirmed the event would be nixed.AP contributed to this story."
378,All eyes on Opec plus meet in Vienna as coronavirus spreads,"New Delhi: With the coronavirus outbreak adding another level of uncertainty to the global energy markets, all eyes are on the two-day meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies starting Thursday, which is expected to announce deeper production cuts. The so called Opec plus meeting in Vienna, which includes Russia, comes in the backdrop of Opec slashing the global oil demand growth by 0.99 million barrels per day (mbpd) in 2020, with the Coronavirus outbreak in China accounting “for most of the downward revision"". Also, the US Federal Reserve reduced its policy rate by 50 basis points on Tuesday.While the global crude oil prices were on a downward spiral in the backdrop of coronavirus outbreak, they gained on Tuesday on production cut expectations. International benchmark Brent crude was trading at $52.26 per barrel. Crude prices hit a record $147 per barrel in July 2008.The World Health Organization (WHO) has upgraded the global risk of the coronavirus outbreak to ""very high"" – its top level of risk assessment.According to Opec’s Monthly Oil Market Report, the demand was lowered by 0.23 mbpd. Concerned over the situation, its technical panel recommended a provisional cut to the Opec plus arrangement. This assumes importance given that any further supply cuts will have wide-ranging impact on energy markets, as Opec accounts for around 40% of global production. Also, the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) has cut global oil demand growth outlook.According to Austin-based Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence platform, the Opec plus arrangement may simply agree to adopt the recommendation of the cartel's technical committee for 600,000 barrels per day cut.Every dollar rise in the price of oil increases India’s import bill by  ₹10,700 crore on an annualized basis. India spent $111.9 billion on oil imports in 2018-19 and is a key Asian refining hub, with an installed capacity of more than 249.4 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) through 23 refineries.“Russia is again finding itself with the upper hand in relation to the Saudis as the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna from March 5-6 approaches. The Saudis face a likely Russian refusal to take their share of a headline cut above 600,000 bpd, and could only go beyond that by caving in and doing more unilaterally, an unatttractive option,"" said Stratfor energy analyst, Greg Priddy.This comes against the backdrop of oil markets facing a situation called contango wherein the spot price is lower than a futures contract.India’s energy needs are mainly met through imports, and Opec accounts for around 83% of the country’s total crude oil imports. Any production cut by the so called Opec plus arrangement may also compromise India’s energy security efforts in the short run. India is the world’s third-largest crude oil buyer and the fourth-largest LNG importer.The oil prices have a major bearing on how consumers such as India manage inflationary and fiscal pressures. Weighed by a decline in the manufacturing sector, India’s factory output contracted in December while retail inflation accelerated for the sixth consecutive month in January, raising doubts on the recovery process of the fledgling Indian economy. India’s economic growth is estimated by the National Statistical Office to hit an 11-year low of 5% in 2019-20 on the back of sluggish consumption and investment demand.The cost of the Indian basket of crude, which averaged $56.43 and $69.88 per barrel in FY18 and FY19, respectively, averaged $65.52 in December 2019, according to data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. The price was 50.94 a barrel on 2 March. The Indian basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.From world famous Louvre museum closing down to an overhang of uncertainty over the impending Japan Olympics, the coronavirus outbreak has been claiming high profile events including Daniel Howard Yergin led CERAWeek.There are also growth concerns triggering worries about another recession of the likes of 2008.“COVID-19 is arguably the biggest risk to global growth since the Great Recession. The rolling geographic nature of the virus’s spread means its duration could be extended into the second quarter,"" S&P Global Platts said in a statement.Battling a severe slowdown, India has been imploring Opec to not affect deeper crude oil production cuts. India has also been pitching for better commercial terms for crude oil imports. Retail prices of petrol and diesel in India track global prices of these fuels, not crude, but they are broadly linked to crude oil price trends.Mint reported on 16 February about the sluggish Indian economy and industries that are heavily dependent on crude oil such as aviation, shipping, road and rail transportation likely to gain from a sudden drop in crude oil prices due to the coronavirus epidemic in China, the world’s biggest oil importer."
379,"The Amazon, Flipkart antitrust case files","BENGALURU :In 2014, Flipkart secured exclusive deals with Motorola and Xiaomi to sell their Moto G and MI 3 models, respectively. At both launches, the phones sold out in a matter of minutes on the e-commerce platform. The customer response on both occasions was a major surprise: Motorola was then a struggling brand, while Xiaomi was an unknown Chinese firm. These two launches transformed e-commerce in India. Over the next six years, smartphones became the single-largest category for Flipkart and its arch-rival Amazon India. As shoppers lapped up low-cost powerful phones, offered at discounts and with EMI (equated monthly instalment) options, sales of smartphones comprised roughly half of all e-commerce transactions in most years.Now, that very success in the smartphone business is being used against Flipkart and Amazon. On 13 January, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced that it would investigate the two largest e-commerce firms following allegations by a traders group that both were engaged in anticompetitive practices in the smartphone category.A few weeks later, Amazon and Flipkart separately obtained a stay from the Karnataka high court on the investigation by CCI. A final court order is expected in the coming months.Whatever the decision of the court, CCI will monitor the e-commerce space very closely over the coming years as part of its wider efforts to rein in internet companies that are challenging the abilities of regulators to govern them effectively. Apart from Amazon India and Flipkart, CCI is also investigating Google and the Oyo-MakeMyTrip pair.At stake in the Amazon India-Flipkart investigation is the legal power of the antitrust regulator to determine the level of competition in the e-commerce space where the gap between Amazon and Flipkart, and the rest of the field has been increasing every year since 2017. The firms have established a virtual duopoly in the e-commerce arena after rivals Snapdeal, ShopClues and Paytm have failed to keep pace with them in recent years.Though Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries has announced grand plans to expand its fledgling e-commerce business, there is no evidence yet that it can become a serious rival to Amazon and Flipkart. Clearly, the two e-commerce firms are, to a large extent, shaping the future of retail, the single-largest part of India’s $3 trillion economy.Retail is also a political battleground, as Amazon and Flipkart have found to their disadvantage in the recent past. A new e-commerce policy introduced in December 2018 temporarily disrupted the supply operations of online retailers and resulted in higher compliance costs. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal has inveighed against Amazon and Flipkart, and indicated that he thinks they’re violating FDI (foreign direct investment) laws.CCI’s actions are being seen as the latest salvo in this regulatory onslaught against the e-commerce companies.Still, the antitrust regulator’s order in January has raised eyebrows—for both the hurried manner in which the investigation was announced and the contents of the order. Technology and antitrust law experts that Mint spoke to said that while there are grounds to conduct an antitrust investigation against Amazon and Flipkart, CCI’s order has several inconsistencies. In some aspects, the regulator has broken with its own precedents without giving a reasonable explanation, they said.CCI, Amazon India and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.A long-time targetFor at least 18 months before it finally announced the investigation in January, CCI had been eyeing the e-commerce companies.In August 2018, CCI had cleared Walmart’s $16 billion acquisition of Flipkart. But in its order, CCI issued a clarion call to the Enforcement Directorate, which looks at FDI violations, to investigate Flipkart. CCI said that “a small number of sellers"" on Flipkart “contributed to substantial sales"" and availed “significant discounts"" from the firm. In effect, the regulator was saying that Flipkart was breaking India’s FDI laws that prohibit marketplaces from discounting.A year later, CCI announced that it would undertake a study of the e-commerce market. On 8 January 2020, the regulator released the findings of the wide-ranging study that included sectors like online travel and online food delivery, apart from online retail. The study all but said that the practices of Flipkart and Amazon veered into anticompetitive territory.The CCI study pointed to deep discounts on online marketplaces and said that “the study could not identify sources of cost savings that may fully explain the deep discounts"". It noted the “bargaining power imbalance and information asymmetry between e-commerce marketplace platforms and their business users"". While the study recommended self-regulation by e-commerce companies, it warned that the “insights gained from the study will inform antitrust enforcement in these markets"".Just five days after the study was released, CCI announced its investigation of Amazon and Flipkart. CCI was responding to a complaint filed by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM), a group representing small traders. DVM is a part of Confederation of All India Traders, a powerful trader lobby that has links with the Bharatiya Janata Party government.DVM had alleged that Amazon and Flipkart gave preferential treatment to a few large sellers affiliated with them by offering deep discounts and prominent listing, apart from selling private labels through these sellers. It also alleged that both firms have exclusive arrangements with brands that hurt competition on the marketplaces. All these practices were alleged to be prevalent in the smartphone business.A flawed orderCCI’s response to DVM’s complaint has several flaws, say experts. To start with, the process leading up to the regulator’s order in January seemed hurried.“The order came just a few days after the market study, which recommended self-regulation—the timing is strange,"" said a partner at a Delhi-based law firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It is hard to understand why the CCI didn’t give the e-commerce firms time to implement some of the suggestions before launching an investigation.""According to norms, CCI typically calls the informant for a “preliminary conference"" before launching a formal investigation, said Nisha Kaur Uberoi, partner and national competition head at Trilegal, a law firm. “However, in the present case, the CCI asked for an affidavit from DVM and immediately thereafter directed an investigation, without calling either DVM or the opposite parties for a preliminary conference, which is unusual because though the CCI is not required to hold the pre-conference by law, it is a norm to call the informant.""Experts say that CCI was wrong to have ordered a probe when the complaint was focused on one sector—smartphones and related accessories. DVM has alleged that exclusive deals between smartphone makers—Xiaomi and OnePlus—and Flipkart and Amazon constitute anticompetitive behaviour.“To say that an exclusive arrangement between an e-commerce company and a smartphone brand on one or some products is having an adverse impact on competition in the entire sector is a stretch,"" said Anupam Manur, assistant professor at think tank Takshashila Institution and an antitrust regulation researcher. “There is no reason given as to why competition is being hurt. There are other smartphone models sold on other sites and in offline stores.""CCI’s own orders in the past have avoided considering specific product categories as “relevant markets"", said Manur. Relevant market, a key concept in antitrust regulation, refers to a defined sector that allows CCI to gauge whether a company has the dominance and market power to harm competition in that space.In April 2015, CCI had dismissed a complaint against Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal similar to DVM’s. An individual had accused the e-commerce firms of predatory pricing and exclusive arrangements. The regulator had said then that the exclusive arrangements in the books and smartphone categories did not have an “appreciable adverse effect on competition"". Further, it added that it was “convinced"" that “every product cannot be taken as a relevant market in itself"". CCI indicated that it did not consider books or specific smartphone brands to be “relevant markets"" by themselves.“When you’re going against the principles that you’ve expressed in previous orders, you need compelling evidence. That isn’t there over here,"" said Manur.One potential error in the DVM complaint and the CCI order was the issue of tags given by Amazon and Flipkart to certain sellers. DVM alleged that Flipkart put the tag of “Assured Seller"" on products sold by a few of its “preferred"" sellers, while Amazon gave the tag of “Fulfilled"" to the products sold by such “preferred"" sellers. These preferred sellers allegedly received discounts from Amazon and Flipkart as well as prominent placement on search results on the sites, it alleged.However, the terms “Assured Seller"" at Flipkart and “Fulfilled"" at Amazon actually refer to products that are stored in company-owned warehouses. Both firms stock these products owned by third-party sellers in their own warehouses in order to deliver them faster whenever customers place orders. Thousands of sellers on Flipkart and Amazon avail of this service.Case against duoAlthough it is unstated, the default goal of internet platforms is to build monopolies.In his 2017 book The Four, Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur and marketing professor, came up with a memorable metaphor for Amazon’s approach of sinking billions of dollars into the task of wowing customers without worrying about profits. He wrote that Amazon was “going under water with the world’s largest oxygen tank, forcing other retailers to follow it, match its prices and deal with changed customer delivery expectations"". But against Amazon’s water tank, or limitless capital, retailers only had “the air in their lungs and are drowning"". After the others are dead, Amazon will surface and have the “ocean of retail largely to itself"", warned Galloway.To prevent such a scenario, Western governments are scrutinizing internet giants like never before, after sleeping at the wheel for years. US and European antitrust regulators have focused their attention on “The Four""—Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook—whose astonishing market power has seen their collective valuations rise to nearly $4 trillion.Many believe that in India, too, Amazon and Flipkart are on course to dominate the retail business over the coming decades. Though e-commerce still comprises less than 5% of retail in India, online retail has grown to nearly $30 billion at the end of 2019 from less than $5 billion in 2014, according to analyst reports.Going by CCI’s study, the purpose of antitrust action is to put curbs on the powers of Amazon and Flipkart and allow small sellers to thrive on the marketplaces, rather than allowing the two firms and a few sellers to establish complete control of the entire e-commerce ecosystem.The Supreme Court has potentially handed a boost to antitrust action in the internet space. Last September, it mandated CCI to probe Uber India after Meru Cabs filed a complaint accusing the US taxi-hailing app of predatory pricing.The ruling indicates that a company could be investigated for predatory pricing even though its market dominance may not be established, said a partner at a law firm, requesting anonymity. “Usually, it is necessary to prove market dominance before predatory pricing can be judged to have happened. So, if the Amazon-Flipkart case goes to the Supreme Court they could face a similar ruling,"" he said.One area in e-commerce where there is a clear-cut potential for antitrust abuse is the private label businesses of Amazon and Flipkart. Both companies have access to data on shopping patterns and preferences of customers, and can use this to offer their labels that are priced lower than other brands. Private label products have higher margins.“This business can have detrimental effects on other sellers in the market. If, in the search listings, private labels are being promoted ahead of others, that’s a problem. It’s a violation of platform neutrality that needs to be investigated,"" said Manur of Takshashila Institution."
380,"Opinion | Why lifelong learning is a necessity, not a choice","A writer friend recently narrated an interesting encounter at a job interview. The candidate claimed and quite proudly too that he does not read books, lest his “style"" will get influenced. Needless to say, the interview ended soon enough with a young man back on the streets looking for a job and a well-paying writing job waiting to be taken. I am sure every recruiter has their own favourite interview stories and perhaps even more unsettling ones than my friend’s. The recruiters’ sense of despondency is quite palpable in situations like this, particularly when often casual work-related discussions land on the subject of lack of skilled workforce even to do routine stuff.The young man’s animosity to books (i.e. to learn something from published writers) may sound like an exception and not indicative of the general trend in the skill market. My response to that would be: may be in lesser degrees, but the problem is there and it is serious.In her recent budget speech, the Union finance minister too spoke about the huge demand for teachers, nurses, paramedical staff and caregivers abroad. “However, their skill sets, many a time, do not match the employer’s standards and, therefore, need to be improved,"" she said.Two words stand out in the minister’s remark: employer’s standard.Today almost every casual work-related discussion is on the subject of the lack of right set of talent in the employee pool. On one hand, the employers are grappling to solve their business problems with an under-skilled workforce. On the other hand, the fresh recruits are finding themselves non-employable or less productive, as their oven-baked degrees are staling faster than expected.Such fundamental shifts in both businesses and job market were long coming. The $180 billion Indian software industry, which grew almost without any government oversight for decades, is now seeking budgetary support to resolve what seems like an existential crisis, with the lobby body Nasscom’s clarion call that the IT workforce may become obsolete unless the government supports reskilling programmes.In its current form and for most parts, our education system is built to fail.I am not saying this casually. If we can agree that the measure of success of education is being productive and efficient in the real world, then clearly the numbers suggest large-scale failure.The writing on the wall is this: the needs of the industry and the larger economic system are constantly changing because of technology and our workforce factories have to keep up.First, we as Indians need to buy into the idea of lifelong learning as a necessity. The dominant mindset of our country is that formal learning stops when one reaches around 25 years and the focus of rest of the life is on experiential learning, typically at workplace.This has also been bolstered by the structure of the current education system. Those who believe they are upskilling through experiential learning, are living in a denial that experiential learning alone cannot prepare them for the transition to a new job, let alone a new career.Individuals will face deep and rapid changes, and many will have to change not only their job but even their occupation, and most will have to modernize their skills and working practices.Then, comes the employers who must focus on driving large-scale reskilling of the existing workforce. Not only would they save a massive talent pool to quit jobs, but a more productive workforce will lead to an upside growth in their revenue.Third, comes the government authorities, who can encourage the masses by providing tax benefits on executive education, in similar lines of life insurance, and asset creation through mutual funds.This is not a linear step by step process, and rather commands for non-linear thinking to make this happen.What is scary is that the skill gap challenge is becoming increasingly perennial. If we dive into the statistics a little deeper, India has over 40 million in the higher education market and there are over 58 million taxpayers in the country.We are host to the largest population under the age of 25 and the second-largest graduate talent pipeline. We’re at a tipping point, where things done right can make India the teaching capital of the world.Ronnie Screwvala is the co-founder and executive chairperson, upGrad."
381,Opinion | Covid-19: Hold off the board exams,"Tough times call for quick responses. Now that the probability of coronavirus-19 fanning out across India has turned into a potent threat, Indian authorities may need to clamp down on various modes of its transmission. The gathering of students in halls to take their board exams is one such mode. In the Delhi suburb of Noida, a school reportedly called off the day’s schedule after a student’s parent tested positive. Another school there declared an off-day as well. As more cases emerge, others could well follow suit. After all, the country may be staring at a far worse health crisis than had been expected. Children are less liked to be afflicted by Covid-19 than older people, but still, their safety should be paramount. As a precaution, it would make sense for Indian educational boards to postpone the ongoing Class X and XII examinations. The Central Board of Secondary Education, run by the government, could convene an emergency meeting to evaluate the risk of contagion through exam halls. The Indian Certificate School Examination, a private equivalent, could do likewise, though it seems certain a decision taken by one would quickly be adopted by the other. There are state-level boards as well, and these could take their own calls depending on local conditions.Though we need not panic, complacency at this early stage of a domestic outbreak of Covid-19 could prove costly. As with all epidemics, acting wisely in good time will make a difference to the disease’s trajectory."
382,FM introduces bill that aims to prevent a PMC-like crisis,"NEW DELHI :Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday introduced a Bill in the Parliament to amend the banking regulation law to give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) more power to regulate cooperative lenders and prevent frauds such as the one seen at Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank Ltd. Introducing the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2020, the finance minister said it is the ‘need of the hour’ to avoid a PMC Bank-like crisis in the future. Sitharaman said that PMC Bank fraud had put a lot of small depositors in difficulty and there were demands that the government should do something about it.Cooperative banks are currently under the dual control of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and RBI. While the role of registrar of cooperative societies includes incorporation, registration, management, audit, supersession of board and liquidation, RBI is responsible for regulatory functions such maintaining cash reserve and capital adequacy, among others.The administrative role will continue to be done by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. The amendments will apply to all urban co-operative banks and multi-state cooperative banks.“It is proposed to bring the co-operative banks on par with the developments in the banking sector through better management and proper regulation of co-operative banks with a view to ensure that the affairs of the co-operative banks are conducted in a manner that protects the interests of the depositors,"" according to the Bill.“It is further proposed to strengthen the co-operative banks by increasing professionalism, enabling access to capital, improving governance and ensuring sound banking through the Reserve Bank of India,"" the Bill said.In September, the RBI superseded PMC Bank’s board after uncovering several irregularities. Cash withdrawals were capped at  ₹1,000 per account for six months, but subsequently relaxed to  ₹50,000 as panic spread among depositors. The minister had also said audit of such banks will be as per central bank’s guidelines and recruitment for banks’ management will be based on certain qualifications. All these steps will be implemented by RBI in a phased manner.The Bill could not be passed as the proceedings in the Lok Sabha were disrupted for the second consecutive day as the ruling party and opposition members argued over discussions on the recent Delhi violence.The budget session, which reconvened after a three-week break, resumed on Monday.With inputs from PTI"
383,Opinion | India can’t escape the world’s glare,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has filed an intervention application at the Supreme Court over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Michelle Bachelet Jeria, who holds that post, has sought to intervene as an amicus curiae, an aid of the court, in cases pending before it on the controversial law. Jeria’s concern, it has been made clear, relates to whether the CAA’s exclusion of Muslims from its naturalization regime squares with the principle of equality under the law, which the country is sworn to uphold. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, for example, prohibits discrimination on racial, ethnic and religious grounds, and India is committed to its provisions. Further, the application cites the Global Compact for Safe, Regular and Orderly Migration, which commits India to ensuring human rights in migratory matters.In response, the ministry of external affairs has said that the law is “an internal matter of India"". It has also said that “no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty"". Legal experts say that this is indeed the first issue that would have to be taken up by the country’s top court, the question of locus standi. Whether or not the apex court admits Jeria’s plea, it is undeniable that anxiety runs high within India over what the law implies for adherents of Islam. This being so, it will probably get harder and harder for India’s citizenship policy to stay out of the world’s glare."
384,India postpones biggest maritime exercise amid coronavirus scare,"New Delhi: New Delhi: India has decided to postpone its biggest maritime exercise, “Milan"", involving around 40 countries in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus infections across the world, two government officials said separately on Tuesday. The multilateral naval drills were to be held off the Visakhapatnam coast from 18-28 March.“The exercise is being postponed due to the coronavirus scare. The new dates have not been finalised yet,"" said the first official cited above.The decision to put off the drill was taken after several countries indicated their inability to take part in the exercise because of the mounting cases of COVID-19 being detected in different parts of the world, the second official cited above said.Around 40 countries were scheduled to take part in the exercise though China was not invited to the drills.“The conduct of MILAN 2020 had generated a very enthusiastic response, with Navies around the world having expressed their desire to participate; and in deference to this interest, the Indian Navy looks forward toward scheduling MILAN at a later convenient date,"" the Indian navy said in a statement.“The Indian Navy would like to whole heartedly thank the numerous navies from near and far for having accepted their invitation to participate in MILAN 2020, as also for the unstinted support provided in the run-up to this event,"" it added.The exercise is traditionally staged off Port Blair but was moved to the eastern seaboard this year as it offers better opportunities for conducting bigger drills.The latest edition of Milan was being organised in the backdrop of China’s growing naval activity in the Indian Ocean region.The countries to whom invitations were sent include Indonesia, France, Mozambique, Sudan, Israel, Qatar, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, Somalia, Kenya, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Myanmar, New Zealand, the US, Tanzania, Comoros, Maldives, Brunei, Philippines, Japan, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Mauritius, Cambodia, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Kuwait, Iran, Madagascar, Bangladesh, Russia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Bahrain, UAE and Seychelles."
385,Coronavirus update: 45 who came in contact with Hyderabad techie isolated,"HYDERABAD :Out of 88 persons who came into contact with the techie tested positive for COVID-19, as many as 45 were admitted to government-run Gandhi Hospital here, Telangana Health Minister Etela Rajender said on Tuesday. He said samples from these people were collected and the results were awaited. The authorities have identified 85 people who came into contact with the techie.They will be kept in isolation for 14 days. ""The remaining people will also be brought to the hospital and subjected to the coronavirus test,"" he said.Those brought to hospital and screened include the techie's family members, those who travelled with him in the bus from Bengaluru to Hyderabad and the staff at a private hospital where he was treated for few days before he approached the Gandhi Hospital.Rajender said the condition of the techie was stable and had improved since Monday.The man, hailing from Hyderabad and working for a Bengaluru-based IT firm, is suspected to have picked up virus in Dubai, where he came in contact with some company representatives from Hong Kong. After returning from Dubai, he spent two days in Bengaluru, meeting company employees and others.After reaching Hyderabad by bus, he approached a private hospital with fever and flu-like symptoms. He continued his treatment as an outpatient for five days and was subsequently admitted there. As there was no improvement in his condition, he came to Gandhi Hospital on March 1.His samples were sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune and they tested positive for COVID-19.A day after the state posted first COVID-19 positive case, the authorities swung into action to beef up the preparatory mechanism. Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao announced  ₹100 crore for necessary infrastructure and other measures to contain the spread of coronavirus.A three-member ministerial committee held a meeting with top officials to review the situation and discuss necessary measures to deal with any situation.The Health Minister told reporters after the meeting that over 3,000 beds would be ready for isolation of patients with suspected symptoms of coronavirus while 250 to 300 beds would be arranged for treatment of positive cases, if necessary.The beds would be arranged at the Military Hospital, Chest Hospital, Gandhi Hospital, Fever Hospital and Vikarabad Hospital, all government-run facilities. In addition to these hospitals, the infrastructure at private medical colleges in and around Hyderabad would also be used.The Health Department has deployed 24 pulmonologists to cater to the people under observation at various hospitals. An equal number of serving pulmonologists are kept stand-by. A large number of retired doctors were also contacted and their willingness was obtained to serve in case of need.The Minister said he spoke to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan over phone and requested him to make the masks available to the state.The meeting also decided to take up awareness campaign on large scale to allay fears and clear the myths about coronavirus. The minister said there was no need for panic.He appealed to people not to believe rumours or false information about coronavirus. He pointed out that the mortality rate of coronavirus is only 3 per cent, which is far less compared to other viruses like swine flu and SARS.He, however, called up on people to take the precautions while going into public places. He said they should use kerchiefs while sneezing and coughing.He hoped that the state would not witness high incidence of coronavirus as there would be less chances of the virus surviving due to increasing temperature."
386,Defence ministry withdraws order on income tax deduction from disability pension,"NEW DELHI :The Ministry of Defence has directed the defence accounts department to withdraw a circular directing banks to deduct income tax from those pensioners affected by disability. The matter had been a sore point with the retired pensioners as well as others in the armed forces and represents a roll back of a decision taken last year.Last year, the defence ministry had said that income tax exemption on disability pension would be available only for those military personnel who have been ‘invalidated’ from service due to disability. It was pointed out that the benefit would not be available for those with disabilities who retire after completion of their service.The move led to an outcry in the defence fraternity with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh promising to look into the matter.The three services chiefs had later recommended that disability pension for military personnel should be exempt from income tax only upto a certain limit and taxed beyond that."
387,France threatens to control prices of face masks,"PARIS :A French official on Tuesday threatened to issue a decree controlling prices of face masks and disinfectant gels used to protect against the virus outbreak if an investigation shows they are being sold at unfairly high prices. Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire also urged the public to avoid ""precautionary shopping"" in supermarkets. Some store shelves, notably in the Oise region north of Paris — the centre of a virus cluster in France — are empty of staples.He said he has asked the office of consumer affairs and fraud prevention to investigate prices for masks and alcohol gels. If widespread abuses are uncovered, he said he ""will not hesitate"" to make high prices unlawful.France has reported 191 cases of the virus, including three on French Caribbean islands, and three deaths.

388,This Chinese billionaire starts satellite venture to challenge SpaceX ,"The Chinese owner of Volvo Cars announced it will become the country’s first private company to build satellites as billionaire Li Shufu follows Elon Musk into space. Li’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. started building a production-and-testing center in Taizhou, Zhejiang province, on Tuesday, it said in a statement. Geely plans to begin the launch of commercial low-orbit satellites by the end of the year, the Hangzhou-based company said.Li is betting his satellites will give Geely an edge in the burgeoning driverless-car industry and provide more accurate navigation systems that can pinpoint locations by the centimeter, not meters. The move also reflects the growing ambitions of one of the auto industry’s most acquisitive tycoons -- besides Volvo, Geely’s bought Lotus Cars and become the biggest shareholder of Daimler AG.“Geely must take the initiative to embrace change, develop through innovation, find new synergies online and offline, and cooperate with global partners to become a global technology leader,"" Li said in the statement.Li has been extending his empire beyond cars by diving into new areas. Geely has invested in the VoloCity air taxi to launch it commercially within the next three years, and the company agreed in 2018 with state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp. to build supersonic trains using homegrown technology.This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.
